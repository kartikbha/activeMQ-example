It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java
In Java 7
new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)
In Java 8
Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02

Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):
BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();
        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
The methods within org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils may also be very handy, e.g.:
/**
 * Reads the contents of a file line by line to a List
 * of Strings using the default encoding for the VM.
 */
static List readLines(File file)

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

Probably not as fast as with buffered IO but quite terse:

    String content;
    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(textFile).useDelimiter("\\Z")) {
        content = scanner.next();
    }
The \Z pattern tells the Scanner that the delimiter is EOF

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}
PS : Don't forget to import java.util.*; for Scanner to work.

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41
3	 	
I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

Much faster than what? It most certainly is not faster than appending to a StringBuffer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:02

@gb96 I thought the same about buffer sizes, but the detailed experiment in this question gave surprising results in a similar context: a 16KB buffer was consistently and noticeably faster. –  chiastic-security Sep 12 '14 at 18:14

ASCII is a TEXT file so you would use Readers for reading. Java also supports reading from a binary file using InputStreams. If the files being read are huge then you would want to use a BufferedReader on top of a FileReader to improve read performance.

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

I've made a small adjustment to stop adding a newline ( \n ) if the last line is reached. code while (line != null) { sb.append(line); line = br.readLine(); // Only add new line when curline is NOT the last line.. if(line != null) { sb.append("\n"); } }code –  Ramon Fincken Apr 16 '13 at 11:07

I feel it is better to explicitly give the encoding option and use the FileInputStream rather than directly the FileReader ? See this question too stackoverflow.com/questions/696626/… `reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("<filePath>", "UTF-8"); –  Alex Punnen Jun 4 '13 at 6:43

Similar to Apache Common IO IOUtils#toString() is sun.misc.IOUtils#readFully(), which is included in the Sun/Oracle JREs. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:55

For performance always call sb.append('\n') in preference to sb.append("\n") as a char is appended to the StringBuilder faster than a String –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:58

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;
}

Probably not as fast as with buffered IO but quite terse:

    String content;
    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(textFile).useDelimiter("\\Z")) {
        content = scanner.next();
    }
The \Z pattern tells the Scanner that the delimiter is EOF

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}
PS : Don't forget to import java.util.*; for Scanner to work.

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

ASCII is a TEXT file so you would use Readers for reading. Java also supports reading from a binary file using InputStreams. If the files being read are huge then you would want to use a BufferedReader on top of a FileReader to improve read performance.

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02
1	 	
Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

I've made a small adjustment to stop adding a newline ( \n ) if the last line is reached. code while (line != null) { sb.append(line); line = br.readLine(); // Only add new line when curline is NOT the last line.. if(line != null) { sb.append("\n"); } }code –  Ramon Fincken Apr 16 '13 at 11:07

I feel it is better to explicitly give the encoding option and use the FileInputStream rather than directly the FileReader ? See this question too stackoverflow.com/questions/696626/… `reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("<filePath>", "UTF-8"); –  Alex Punnen Jun 4 '13 at 6:43

For performance always call sb.append('\n') in preference to sb.append("\n") as a char is appended to the StringBuilder faster than a String –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:58

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;

The methods within org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils may also be very handy, e.g.:

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

I don't see it mentioned yet in the other answers so far. But if "Best" means speed, then the new Java I/O (NIO) might provide the fastest preformance, but not always the easiest to figure out for someone learning.

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();

metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

ASCII is a TEXT file so you would use Readers for reading. Java also supports reading from a binary file using InputStreams. If the files being read are huge then you would want to use a BufferedReader on top of a FileReader to improve read performance.

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02
1	 	
Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

I've made a small adjustment to stop adding a newline ( \n ) if the last line is reached. code while (line != null) { sb.append(line); line = br.readLine(); // Only add new line when curline is NOT the last line.. if(line != null) { sb.append("\n"); } }code –  Ramon Fincken Apr 16 '13 at 11:07

I feel it is better to explicitly give the encoding option and use the FileInputStream rather than directly the FileReader ? See this question too stackoverflow.com/questions/696626/… `reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("<filePath>", "UTF-8"); –  Alex Punnen Jun 4 '13 at 6:43

Similar to Apache Common IO IOUtils#toString() is sun.misc.IOUtils#readFully(), which is included in the Sun/Oracle JREs. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:55

For performance always call sb.append('\n') in preference to sb.append("\n") as a char is appended to the StringBuilder faster than a String –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:58

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;
}

This technique assumes that read() fills the buffer; that the number of chars equals the number of bytes; that the number of bytes fits into memory; and that the number of bytes fits into an integer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:01

The methods within org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils may also be very handy, e.g.:

/**
 * Reads the contents of a file line by line to a List
 * of Strings using the default encoding for the VM.
 */
static List readLines(File file)

Or if you prefer Guava (a more modern, actively maintained library), it has similar utilities in its Files class. Simple examples in this answer. –  Jonik Dec 29 '13 at 13:26 
  	 	
or you simply use the built in method to get all lines: docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:50

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

Unfortunately, nowadays there is no readLines(String) and readLines(File) is deprecated in favor of readLines(File, Charset). The encoding can be supplied also as a string. –  Palec Feb 15 at 11:46

I don't see it mentioned yet in the other answers so far. But if "Best" means speed, then the new Java I/O (NIO) might provide the fastest preformance, but not always the easiest to figure out for someone learning.

Probably not as fast as with buffered IO but quite terse:

    String content;
    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(textFile).useDelimiter("\\Z")) {
        content = scanner.next();
    }
The \Z pattern tells the Scanner that the delimiter is EOF

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}
PS : Don't forget to import java.util.*; for Scanner to work.

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

Much faster than what? It most certainly is not faster than appending to a StringBuffer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:02

@gb96 I thought the same about buffer sizes, but the detailed experiment in this question gave surprising results in a similar context: a 16KB buffer was consistently and noticeably faster. –  chiastic-security Sep 12 '14 at 18:14

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02

Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;
}

The methods within org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils may also be very handy, e.g.:

/**
 * Reads the contents of a file line by line to a List
 * of Strings using the default encoding for the VM.

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

I don't see it mentioned yet in the other answers so far. But if "Best" means speed, then the new Java I/O (NIO) might provide the fastest preformance, but not always the easiest to figure out for someone learning.

Probably not as fast as with buffered IO but quite terse:

    String content;
    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(textFile).useDelimiter("\\Z")) {
        content = scanner.next();
    }
The \Z pattern tells the Scanner that the delimiter is EOF

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}
PS : Don't forget to import java.util.*; for Scanner to work.

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;
}

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

I don't see it mentioned yet in the other answers so far. But if "Best" means speed, then the new Java I/O (NIO) might provide the fastest preformance, but not always the easiest to figure out for someone learning.

Probably not as fast as with buffered IO but quite terse:

    String content;
    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(textFile).useDelimiter("\\Z")) {
        content = scanner.next();
    }
The \Z pattern tells the Scanner that the delimiter is EOF

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}
PS : Don't forget to import java.util.*; for Scanner to work.

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

Much faster than what? It most certainly is not faster than appending to a StringBuffer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:02

@gb96 I thought the same about buffer sizes, but the detailed experiment in this question gave surprising results in a similar context: a 16KB buffer was consistently and noticeably faster. –  chiastic-security Sep 12 '14 at 18:14

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

ASCII is a TEXT file so you would use Readers for reading. Java also supports reading from a binary file using InputStreams. If the files being read are huge then you would want to use a BufferedReader on top of a FileReader to improve read performance.

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02
1	 	
Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

Probably not as fast as with buffered IO but quite terse:

    String content;
    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(textFile).useDelimiter("\\Z")) {

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}
PS : Don't forget to import java.util.*; for Scanner to work.

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

ASCII is a TEXT file so you would use Readers for reading. Java also supports reading from a binary file using InputStreams. If the files being read are huge then you would want to use a BufferedReader on top of a FileReader to improve read performance.

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02
1	 	
Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

I've made a small adjustment to stop adding a newline ( \n ) if the last line is reached. code while (line != null) { sb.append(line); line = br.readLine(); // Only add new line when curline is NOT the last line.. if(line != null) { sb.append("\n"); } }code –  Ramon Fincken Apr 16 '13 at 11:07

I feel it is better to explicitly give the encoding option and use the FileInputStream rather than directly the FileReader ? See this question too stackoverflow.com/questions/696626/… `reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("<filePath>", "UTF-8"); –  Alex Punnen Jun 4 '13 at 6:43

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;

The methods within org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils may also be very handy, e.g.:

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

Use the code below to read it:

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

ASCII is a TEXT file so you would use Readers for reading. Java also supports reading from a binary file using InputStreams. If the files being read are huge then you would want to use a BufferedReader on top of a FileReader to improve read performance.

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02
1	 	
Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

I've made a small adjustment to stop adding a newline ( \n ) if the last line is reached. code while (line != null) { sb.append(line); line = br.readLine(); // Only add new line when curline is NOT the last line.. if(line != null) { sb.append("\n"); } }code –  Ramon Fincken Apr 16 '13 at 11:07

I feel it is better to explicitly give the encoding option and use the FileInputStream rather than directly the FileReader ? See this question too stackoverflow.com/questions/696626/… `reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("<filePath>", "UTF-8"); –  Alex Punnen Jun 4 '13 at 6:43

Similar to Apache Common IO IOUtils#toString() is sun.misc.IOUtils#readFully(), which is included in the Sun/Oracle JREs. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:55

For performance always call sb.append('\n') in preference to sb.append("\n") as a char is appended to the StringBuilder faster than a String –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:58

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;
}

This technique assumes that read() fills the buffer; that the number of chars equals the number of bytes; that the number of bytes fits into memory; and that the number of bytes fits into an integer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:01

The methods within org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils may also be very handy, e.g.:

/**
 * Reads the contents of a file line by line to a List
 * of Strings using the default encoding for the VM.
 */
static List readLines(File file)

Or if you prefer Guava (a more modern, actively maintained library), it has similar utilities in its Files class. Simple examples in this answer. –  Jonik Dec 29 '13 at 13:26 
  	 	
or you simply use the built in method to get all lines: docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:50

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

Unfortunately, nowadays there is no readLines(String) and readLines(File) is deprecated in favor of readLines(File, Charset). The encoding can be supplied also as a string. –  Palec Feb 15 at 11:46

I don't see it mentioned yet in the other answers so far. But if "Best" means speed, then the new Java I/O (NIO) might provide the fastest preformance, but not always the easiest to figure out for someone learning.

Probably not as fast as with buffered IO but quite terse:

    String content;
    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(textFile).useDelimiter("\\Z")) {
        content = scanner.next();
    }
The \Z pattern tells the Scanner that the delimiter is EOF

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}
PS : Don't forget to import java.util.*; for Scanner to work.

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02

Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

I've made a small adjustment to stop adding a newline ( \n ) if the last line is reached. code while (line != null) { sb.append(line); line = br.readLine(); // Only add new line when curline is NOT the last line.. if(line != null) { sb.append("\n"); } }code –  Ramon Fincken Apr 16 '13 at 11:07

I feel it is better to explicitly give the encoding option and use the FileInputStream rather than directly the FileReader ? See this question too stackoverflow.com/questions/696626/… `reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("<filePath>", "UTF-8"); –  Alex Punnen Jun 4 '13 at 6:43

Similar to Apache Common IO IOUtils#toString() is sun.misc.IOUtils#readFully(), which is included in the Sun/Oracle JREs. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:55

For performance always call sb.append('\n') in preference to sb.append("\n") as a char is appended to the StringBuilder faster than a String –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:58

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;
}

The methods within org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils may also be very handy, e.g.:

/**
 * Reads the contents of a file line by line to a List
 * of Strings using the default encoding for the VM.

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

I don't see it mentioned yet in the other answers so far. But if "Best" means speed, then the new Java I/O (NIO) might provide the fastest preformance, but not always the easiest to figure out for someone learning.

Probably not as fast as with buffered IO but quite terse:

    String content;
    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(textFile).useDelimiter("\\Z")) {
        content = scanner.next();
    }
The \Z pattern tells the Scanner that the delimiter is EOF

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}
PS : Don't forget to import java.util.*; for Scanner to work.

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;
}

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

I don't see it mentioned yet in the other answers so far. But if "Best" means speed, then the new Java I/O (NIO) might provide the fastest preformance, but not always the easiest to figure out for someone learning.

Probably not as fast as with buffered IO but quite terse:

    String content;
    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(textFile).useDelimiter("\\Z")) {
        content = scanner.next();
    }
The \Z pattern tells the Scanner that the delimiter is EOF

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}
PS : Don't forget to import java.util.*; for Scanner to work.

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

Much faster than what? It most certainly is not faster than appending to a StringBuffer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:02

@gb96 I thought the same about buffer sizes, but the detailed experiment in this question gave surprising results in a similar context: a 16KB buffer was consistently and noticeably faster. –  chiastic-security Sep 12 '14 at 18:14

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

ASCII is a TEXT file so you would use Readers for reading. Java also supports reading from a binary file using InputStreams. If the files being read are huge then you would want to use a BufferedReader on top of a FileReader to improve read performance.

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02
1	 	
Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception

        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)

            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

Much faster than what? It most certainly is not faster than appending to a StringBuffer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:02

@gb96 I thought the same about buffer sizes, but the detailed experiment in this question gave surprising results in a similar context: a 16KB buffer was consistently and noticeably faster. –  chiastic-security Sep 12 '14 at 18:14

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

ASCII is a TEXT file so you would use Readers for reading. Java also supports reading from a binary file using InputStreams. If the files being read are huge then you would want to use a BufferedReader on top of a FileReader to improve read performance.

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02
1	 	
Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

I've made a small adjustment to stop adding a newline ( \n ) if the last line is reached. code while (line != null) { sb.append(line); line = br.readLine(); // Only add new line when curline is NOT the last line.. if(line != null) { sb.append("\n"); } }code –  Ramon Fincken Apr 16 '13 at 11:07

I feel it is better to explicitly give the encoding option and use the FileInputStream rather than directly the FileReader ? See this question too stackoverflow.com/questions/696626/… `reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("<filePath>", "UTF-8"); –  Alex Punnen Jun 4 '13 at 6:43

Similar to Apache Common IO IOUtils#toString() is sun.misc.IOUtils#readFully(), which is included in the Sun/Oracle JREs. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:55

For performance always call sb.append('\n') in preference to sb.append("\n") as a char is appended to the StringBuilder faster than a String –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:58

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

I also disagree with closing as "not constructive". Fortunately, this could well be closed as duplicate.

ASCII is a TEXT file so you would use Readers for reading. Java also supports reading from a binary file using InputStreams. If the files being read are huge then you would want to use a BufferedReader on top of a FileReader to improve read performance.

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02
1	 	
Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

I've made a small adjustment to stop adding a newline ( \n ) if the last line is reached. code while (line != null) { sb.append(line); line = br.readLine(); // Only add new line when curline is NOT the last line.. if(line != null) { sb.append("\n"); } }code –  Ramon Fincken Apr 16 '13 at 11:07

I feel it is better to explicitly give the encoding option and use the FileInputStream rather than directly the FileReader ? See this question too stackoverflow.com/questions/696626/… `reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("<filePath>", "UTF-8"); –  Alex Punnen Jun 4 '13 at 6:43

Similar to Apache Common IO IOUtils#toString() is sun.misc.IOUtils#readFully(), which is included in the Sun/Oracle JREs. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:55

For performance always call sb.append('\n') in preference to sb.append("\n") as a char is appended to the StringBuilder faster than a String –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:58

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;
}

This technique assumes that read() fills the buffer; that the number of chars equals the number of bytes; that the number of bytes fits into memory; and that the number of bytes fits into an integer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:01

The methods within org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils may also be very handy, e.g.:

/**
 * Reads the contents of a file line by line to a List
 * of Strings using the default encoding for the VM.

static List readLines(File file)

Or if you prefer Guava (a more modern, actively maintained library), it has similar utilities in its Files class. Simple examples in this answer. –  Jonik Dec 29 '13 at 13:26 
  	 	
or you simply use the built in method to get all lines: docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:50

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

Unfortunately, nowadays there is no readLines(String) and readLines(File) is deprecated in favor of readLines(File, Charset). The encoding can be supplied also as a string. –  Palec Feb 15 at 11:46

I don't see it mentioned yet in the other answers so far. But if "Best" means speed, then the new Java I/O (NIO) might provide the fastest preformance, but not always the easiest to figure out for someone learning.

Probably not as fast as with buffered IO but quite terse:

    String content;
    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(textFile).useDelimiter("\\Z")) {
        content = scanner.next();
    }
The \Z pattern tells the Scanner that the delimiter is EOF

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}
PS : Don't forget to import java.util.*; for Scanner to work.

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02

Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

I've made a small adjustment to stop adding a newline ( \n ) if the last line is reached. code while (line != null) { sb.append(line); line = br.readLine(); // Only add new line when curline is NOT the last line.. if(line != null) { sb.append("\n"); } }code –  Ramon Fincken Apr 16 '13 at 11:07

I feel it is better to explicitly give the encoding option and use the FileInputStream rather than directly the FileReader ? See this question too stackoverflow.com/questions/696626/… `reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("<filePath>", "UTF-8"); –  Alex Punnen Jun 4 '13 at 6:43

Similar to Apache Common IO IOUtils#toString() is sun.misc.IOUtils#readFully(), which is included in the Sun/Oracle JREs. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:55

For performance always call sb.append('\n') in preference to sb.append("\n") as a char is appended to the StringBuilder faster than a String –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:58

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;
}

This technique assumes that read() fills the buffer; that the number of chars equals the number of bytes; that the number of bytes fits into memory; and that the number of bytes fits into an integer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:01

The methods within org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils may also be very handy, e.g.:

/**
 * Reads the contents of a file line by line to a List
 * of Strings using the default encoding for the VM.
 */
static List readLines(File file)

Or if you prefer Guava (a more modern, actively maintained library), it has similar utilities in its Files class. Simple examples in this answer. –  Jonik Dec 29 '13 at 13:26

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

I don't see it mentioned yet in the other answers so far. But if "Best" means speed, then the new Java I/O (NIO) might provide the fastest preformance, but not always the easiest to figure out for someone learning.

Probably not as fast as with buffered IO but quite terse:

    String content;
    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(textFile).useDelimiter("\\Z")) {
        content = scanner.next();
    }
The \Z pattern tells the Scanner that the delimiter is EOF

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}
PS : Don't forget to import java.util.*; for Scanner to work.

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

Much faster than what? It most certainly is not faster than appending to a StringBuffer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:02

@gb96 I thought the same about buffer sizes, but the detailed experiment in this question gave surprising results in a similar context: a 16KB buffer was consistently and noticeably faster. –  chiastic-security Sep 12 '14 at 18:14

I've made a small adjustment to stop adding a newline ( \n ) if the last line is reached. code while (line != null) { sb.append(line); line = br.readLine(); // Only add new line when curline is NOT the last line.. if(line != null) { sb.append("\n"); } }code –  Ramon Fincken Apr 16 '13 at 11:07

I feel it is better to explicitly give the encoding option and use the FileInputStream rather than directly the FileReader ? See this question too stackoverflow.com/questions/696626/… `reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("<filePath>", "UTF-8"); –  Alex Punnen Jun 4 '13 at 6:43

Similar to Apache Common IO IOUtils#toString() is sun.misc.IOUtils#readFully(), which is included in the Sun/Oracle JREs. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:55

For performance always call sb.append('\n') in preference to sb.append("\n") as a char is appended to the StringBuilder faster than a String –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:58

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;
}

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

Much faster than what? It most certainly is not faster than appending to a StringBuffer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:02

@gb96 I thought the same about buffer sizes, but the detailed experiment in this question gave surprising results in a similar context: a 16KB buffer was consistently and noticeably faster. –  chiastic-security Sep 12 '14 at 18:14

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

ASCII is a TEXT file so you would use Readers for reading. Java also supports reading from a binary file using InputStreams. If the files being read are huge then you would want to use a BufferedReader on top of a FileReader to improve read performance.

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02
1	 	
Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }

The methods within org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils may also be very handy, e.g.:

/**
 * Reads the contents of a file line by line to a List
 * of Strings using the default encoding for the VM.
 */
static List readLines(File file)

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

I also disagree with closing as "not constructive". Fortunately, this could well be closed as duplicate.

ASCII is a TEXT file so you would use Readers for reading. Java also supports reading from a binary file using InputStreams. If the files being read are huge then you would want to use a BufferedReader on top of a FileReader to improve read performance.

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02
1	 	
Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

I've made a small adjustment to stop adding a newline ( \n ) if the last line is reached. code while (line != null) { sb.append(line); line = br.readLine(); // Only add new line when curline is NOT the last line.. if(line != null) { sb.append("\n"); } }code –  Ramon Fincken Apr 16 '13 at 11:07

I feel it is better to explicitly give the encoding option and use the FileInputStream rather than directly the FileReader ? See this question too stackoverflow.com/questions/696626/… `reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("<filePath>", "UTF-8"); –  Alex Punnen Jun 4 '13 at 6:43

Similar to Apache Common IO IOUtils#toString() is sun.misc.IOUtils#readFully(), which is included in the Sun/Oracle JREs. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:55

For performance always call sb.append('\n') in preference to sb.append("\n") as a char is appended to the StringBuilder faster than a String –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:58

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;
}

This technique assumes that read() fills the buffer; that the number of chars equals the number of bytes; that the number of bytes fits into memory; and that the number of bytes fits into an integer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:01

The methods within org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils may also be very handy, e.g.:

/**
 * Reads the contents of a file line by line to a List
 * of Strings using the default encoding for the VM.

static List readLines(File file)

Or if you prefer Guava (a more modern, actively maintained library), it has similar utilities in its Files class. Simple examples in this answer. –  Jonik Dec 29 '13 at 13:26 
  	 	
or you simply use the built in method to get all lines: docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:50

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

Unfortunately, nowadays there is no readLines(String) and readLines(File) is deprecated in favor of readLines(File, Charset). The encoding can be supplied also as a string. –  Palec Feb 15 at 11:46

I don't see it mentioned yet in the other answers so far. But if "Best" means speed, then the new Java I/O (NIO) might provide the fastest preformance, but not always the easiest to figure out for someone learning.

Probably not as fast as with buffered IO but quite terse:

    String content;
    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(textFile).useDelimiter("\\Z")) {
        content = scanner.next();
    }
The \Z pattern tells the Scanner that the delimiter is EOF

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}
PS : Don't forget to import java.util.*; for Scanner to work.

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02

Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

I've made a small adjustment to stop adding a newline ( \n ) if the last line is reached. code while (line != null) { sb.append(line); line = br.readLine(); // Only add new line when curline is NOT the last line.. if(line != null) { sb.append("\n"); } }code –  Ramon Fincken Apr 16 '13 at 11:07

I feel it is better to explicitly give the encoding option and use the FileInputStream rather than directly the FileReader ? See this question too stackoverflow.com/questions/696626/… `reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("<filePath>", "UTF-8"); –  Alex Punnen Jun 4 '13 at 6:43

Similar to Apache Common IO IOUtils#toString() is sun.misc.IOUtils#readFully(), which is included in the Sun/Oracle JREs. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:55

For performance always call sb.append('\n') in preference to sb.append("\n") as a char is appended to the StringBuilder faster than a String –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:58

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;
}

This technique assumes that read() fills the buffer; that the number of chars equals the number of bytes; that the number of bytes fits into memory; and that the number of bytes fits into an integer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:01

The methods within org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils may also be very handy, e.g.:

/**
 * Reads the contents of a file line by line to a List
 * of Strings using the default encoding for the VM.
 */
static List readLines(File file)

Or if you prefer Guava (a more modern, actively maintained library), it has similar utilities in its Files class. Simple examples in this answer. –  Jonik Dec 29 '13 at 13:26

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

I don't see it mentioned yet in the other answers so far. But if "Best" means speed, then the new Java I/O (NIO) might provide the fastest preformance, but not always the easiest to figure out for someone learning.

Probably not as fast as with buffered IO but quite terse:

    String content;
    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(textFile).useDelimiter("\\Z")) {
        content = scanner.next();
    }
The \Z pattern tells the Scanner that the delimiter is EOF

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}
PS : Don't forget to import java.util.*; for Scanner to work.

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

Much faster than what? It most certainly is not faster than appending to a StringBuffer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:02

@gb96 I thought the same about buffer sizes, but the detailed experiment in this question gave surprising results in a similar context: a 16KB buffer was consistently and noticeably faster. –  chiastic-security Sep 12 '14 at 18:14

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;
}

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

I don't see it mentioned yet in the other answers so far. But if "Best" means speed, then the new Java I/O (NIO) might provide the fastest preformance, but not always the easiest to figure out for someone learning.

Probably not as fast as with buffered IO but quite terse:

    String content;
    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(textFile).useDelimiter("\\Z")) {
        content = scanner.next();
    }
The \Z pattern tells the Scanner that the delimiter is EOF

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}
PS : Don't forget to import java.util.*; for Scanner to work.

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

Much faster than what? It most certainly is not faster than appending to a StringBuffer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:02

@gb96 I thought the same about buffer sizes, but the detailed experiment in this question gave surprising results in a similar context: a 16KB buffer was consistently and noticeably faster. –  chiastic-security Sep 12 '14 at 18:14

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

ASCII is a TEXT file so you would use Readers for reading. Java also supports reading from a binary file using InputStreams. If the files being read are huge then you would want to use a BufferedReader on top of a FileReader to improve read performance.

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02
1	 	
Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception

        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)

            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

Much faster than what? It most certainly is not faster than appending to a StringBuffer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:02

@gb96 I thought the same about buffer sizes, but the detailed experiment in this question gave surprising results in a similar context: a 16KB buffer was consistently and noticeably faster. –  chiastic-security Sep 12 '14 at 18:14

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

ASCII is a TEXT file so you would use Readers for reading. Java also supports reading from a binary file using InputStreams. If the files being read are huge then you would want to use a BufferedReader on top of a FileReader to improve read performance.

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02
1	 	
Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

I've made a small adjustment to stop adding a newline ( \n ) if the last line is reached. code while (line != null) { sb.append(line); line = br.readLine(); // Only add new line when curline is NOT the last line.. if(line != null) { sb.append("\n"); } }code –  Ramon Fincken Apr 16 '13 at 11:07

I feel it is better to explicitly give the encoding option and use the FileInputStream rather than directly the FileReader ? See this question too stackoverflow.com/questions/696626/… `reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("<filePath>", "UTF-8"); –  Alex Punnen Jun 4 '13 at 6:43

Similar to Apache Common IO IOUtils#toString() is sun.misc.IOUtils#readFully(), which is included in the Sun/Oracle JREs. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:55

For performance always call sb.append('\n') in preference to sb.append("\n") as a char is appended to the StringBuilder faster than a String –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:58

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

I also disagree with closing as "not constructive". Fortunately, this could well be closed as duplicate.

ASCII is a TEXT file so you would use Readers for reading. Java also supports reading from a binary file using InputStreams. If the files being read are huge then you would want to use a BufferedReader on top of a FileReader to improve read performance.

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02
1	 	
Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

I've made a small adjustment to stop adding a newline ( \n ) if the last line is reached. code while (line != null) { sb.append(line); line = br.readLine(); // Only add new line when curline is NOT the last line.. if(line != null) { sb.append("\n"); } }code –  Ramon Fincken Apr 16 '13 at 11:07

I feel it is better to explicitly give the encoding option and use the FileInputStream rather than directly the FileReader ? See this question too stackoverflow.com/questions/696626/… `reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("<filePath>", "UTF-8"); –  Alex Punnen Jun 4 '13 at 6:43

Similar to Apache Common IO IOUtils#toString() is sun.misc.IOUtils#readFully(), which is included in the Sun/Oracle JREs. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:55

For performance always call sb.append('\n') in preference to sb.append("\n") as a char is appended to the StringBuilder faster than a String –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:58

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;
}

This technique assumes that read() fills the buffer; that the number of chars equals the number of bytes; that the number of bytes fits into memory; and that the number of bytes fits into an integer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:01

The methods within org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils may also be very handy, e.g.:

/**
 * Reads the contents of a file line by line to a List
 * of Strings using the default encoding for the VM.

static List readLines(File file)

Or if you prefer Guava (a more modern, actively maintained library), it has similar utilities in its Files class. Simple examples in this answer. –  Jonik Dec 29 '13 at 13:26 
  	 	
or you simply use the built in method to get all lines: docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:50

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

Unfortunately, nowadays there is no readLines(String) and readLines(File) is deprecated in favor of readLines(File, Charset). The encoding can be supplied also as a string. –  Palec Feb 15 at 11:46

I don't see it mentioned yet in the other answers so far. But if "Best" means speed, then the new Java I/O (NIO) might provide the fastest preformance, but not always the easiest to figure out for someone learning.

Probably not as fast as with buffered IO but quite terse:

    String content;
    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(textFile).useDelimiter("\\Z")) {
        content = scanner.next();
    }
The \Z pattern tells the Scanner that the delimiter is EOF

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}
PS : Don't forget to import java.util.*; for Scanner to work.

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02

Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

I've made a small adjustment to stop adding a newline ( \n ) if the last line is reached. code while (line != null) { sb.append(line); line = br.readLine(); // Only add new line when curline is NOT the last line.. if(line != null) { sb.append("\n"); } }code –  Ramon Fincken Apr 16 '13 at 11:07

I feel it is better to explicitly give the encoding option and use the FileInputStream rather than directly the FileReader ? See this question too stackoverflow.com/questions/696626/… `reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("<filePath>", "UTF-8"); –  Alex Punnen Jun 4 '13 at 6:43

Similar to Apache Common IO IOUtils#toString() is sun.misc.IOUtils#readFully(), which is included in the Sun/Oracle JREs. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:55

For performance always call sb.append('\n') in preference to sb.append("\n") as a char is appended to the StringBuilder faster than a String –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:58

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;
}

This technique assumes that read() fills the buffer; that the number of chars equals the number of bytes; that the number of bytes fits into memory; and that the number of bytes fits into an integer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:01

The methods within org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils may also be very handy, e.g.:

/**
 * Reads the contents of a file line by line to a List
 * of Strings using the default encoding for the VM.
 */
static List readLines(File file)

Or if you prefer Guava (a more modern, actively maintained library), it has similar utilities in its Files class. Simple examples in this answer. –  Jonik Dec 29 '13 at 13:26

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

I don't see it mentioned yet in the other answers so far. But if "Best" means speed, then the new Java I/O (NIO) might provide the fastest preformance, but not always the easiest to figure out for someone learning.

Probably not as fast as with buffered IO but quite terse:

    String content;
    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(textFile).useDelimiter("\\Z")) {
        content = scanner.next();
    }
The \Z pattern tells the Scanner that the delimiter is EOF

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}
PS : Don't forget to import java.util.*; for Scanner to work.

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

Much faster than what? It most certainly is not faster than appending to a StringBuffer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:02

@gb96 I thought the same about buffer sizes, but the detailed experiment in this question gave surprising results in a similar context: a 16KB buffer was consistently and noticeably faster. –  chiastic-security Sep 12 '14 at 18:14

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;
}

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

I don't see it mentioned yet in the other answers so far. But if "Best" means speed, then the new Java I/O (NIO) might provide the fastest preformance, but not always the easiest to figure out for someone learning.

Probably not as fast as with buffered IO but quite terse:

    String content;
    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(textFile).useDelimiter("\\Z")) {
        content = scanner.next();
    }
The \Z pattern tells the Scanner that the delimiter is EOF

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}
PS : Don't forget to import java.util.*; for Scanner to work.

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

Much faster than what? It most certainly is not faster than appending to a StringBuffer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:02

@gb96 I thought the same about buffer sizes, but the detailed experiment in this question gave surprising results in a similar context: a 16KB buffer was consistently and noticeably faster. –  chiastic-security Sep 12 '14 at 18:14

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

ASCII is a TEXT file so you would use Readers for reading. Java also supports reading from a binary file using InputStreams. If the files being read are huge then you would want to use a BufferedReader on top of a FileReader to improve read performance.

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02
1	 	
Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception

        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)

            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

Much faster than what? It most certainly is not faster than appending to a StringBuffer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:02

@gb96 I thought the same about buffer sizes, but the detailed experiment in this question gave surprising results in a similar context: a 16KB buffer was consistently and noticeably faster. –  chiastic-security Sep 12 '14 at 18:14

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

ASCII is a TEXT file so you would use Readers for reading. Java also supports reading from a binary file using InputStreams. If the files being read are huge then you would want to use a BufferedReader on top of a FileReader to improve read performance.

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02
1	 	
Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

I've made a small adjustment to stop adding a newline ( \n ) if the last line is reached. code while (line != null) { sb.append(line); line = br.readLine(); // Only add new line when curline is NOT the last line.. if(line != null) { sb.append("\n"); } }code –  Ramon Fincken Apr 16 '13 at 11:07

I feel it is better to explicitly give the encoding option and use the FileInputStream rather than directly the FileReader ? See this question too stackoverflow.com/questions/696626/… `reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("<filePath>", "UTF-8"); –  Alex Punnen Jun 4 '13 at 6:43

Similar to Apache Common IO IOUtils#toString() is sun.misc.IOUtils#readFully(), which is included in the Sun/Oracle JREs. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:55

For performance always call sb.append('\n') in preference to sb.append("\n") as a char is appended to the StringBuilder faster than a String –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:58

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

I also disagree with closing as "not constructive". Fortunately, this could well be closed as duplicate.

ASCII is a TEXT file so you would use Readers for reading. Java also supports reading from a binary file using InputStreams. If the files being read are huge then you would want to use a BufferedReader on top of a FileReader to improve read performance.

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02
1	 	
Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

I've made a small adjustment to stop adding a newline ( \n ) if the last line is reached. code while (line != null) { sb.append(line); line = br.readLine(); // Only add new line when curline is NOT the last line.. if(line != null) { sb.append("\n"); } }code –  Ramon Fincken Apr 16 '13 at 11:07

I feel it is better to explicitly give the encoding option and use the FileInputStream rather than directly the FileReader ? See this question too stackoverflow.com/questions/696626/… `reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("<filePath>", "UTF-8"); –  Alex Punnen Jun 4 '13 at 6:43

Similar to Apache Common IO IOUtils#toString() is sun.misc.IOUtils#readFully(), which is included in the Sun/Oracle JREs. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:55

For performance always call sb.append('\n') in preference to sb.append("\n") as a char is appended to the StringBuilder faster than a String –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:58

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;
}

This technique assumes that read() fills the buffer; that the number of chars equals the number of bytes; that the number of bytes fits into memory; and that the number of bytes fits into an integer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:01

The methods within org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils may also be very handy, e.g.:

/**
 * Reads the contents of a file line by line to a List
 * of Strings using the default encoding for the VM.

static List readLines(File file)

Or if you prefer Guava (a more modern, actively maintained library), it has similar utilities in its Files class. Simple examples in this answer. –  Jonik Dec 29 '13 at 13:26 
  	 	
or you simply use the built in method to get all lines: docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:50

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

Unfortunately, nowadays there is no readLines(String) and readLines(File) is deprecated in favor of readLines(File, Charset). The encoding can be supplied also as a string. –  Palec Feb 15 at 11:46

I don't see it mentioned yet in the other answers so far. But if "Best" means speed, then the new Java I/O (NIO) might provide the fastest preformance, but not always the easiest to figure out for someone learning.

Probably not as fast as with buffered IO but quite terse:

    String content;
    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(textFile).useDelimiter("\\Z")) {
        content = scanner.next();
    }
The \Z pattern tells the Scanner that the delimiter is EOF

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}
PS : Don't forget to import java.util.*; for Scanner to work.

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02

Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

I've made a small adjustment to stop adding a newline ( \n ) if the last line is reached. code while (line != null) { sb.append(line); line = br.readLine(); // Only add new line when curline is NOT the last line.. if(line != null) { sb.append("\n"); } }code –  Ramon Fincken Apr 16 '13 at 11:07

I feel it is better to explicitly give the encoding option and use the FileInputStream rather than directly the FileReader ? See this question too stackoverflow.com/questions/696626/… `reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("<filePath>", "UTF-8"); –  Alex Punnen Jun 4 '13 at 6:43

Similar to Apache Common IO IOUtils#toString() is sun.misc.IOUtils#readFully(), which is included in the Sun/Oracle JREs. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:55

For performance always call sb.append('\n') in preference to sb.append("\n") as a char is appended to the StringBuilder faster than a String –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:58

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;
}

This technique assumes that read() fills the buffer; that the number of chars equals the number of bytes; that the number of bytes fits into memory; and that the number of bytes fits into an integer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:01

The methods within org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils may also be very handy, e.g.:

/**
 * Reads the contents of a file line by line to a List
 * of Strings using the default encoding for the VM.
 */
static List readLines(File file)

Or if you prefer Guava (a more modern, actively maintained library), it has similar utilities in its Files class. Simple examples in this answer. –  Jonik Dec 29 '13 at 13:26

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

I don't see it mentioned yet in the other answers so far. But if "Best" means speed, then the new Java I/O (NIO) might provide the fastest preformance, but not always the easiest to figure out for someone learning.

Probably not as fast as with buffered IO but quite terse:

    String content;
    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(textFile).useDelimiter("\\Z")) {
        content = scanner.next();
    }
The \Z pattern tells the Scanner that the delimiter is EOF

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}
PS : Don't forget to import java.util.*; for Scanner to work.

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

Much faster than what? It most certainly is not faster than appending to a StringBuffer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:02

@gb96 I thought the same about buffer sizes, but the detailed experiment in this question gave surprising results in a similar context: a 16KB buffer was consistently and noticeably faster. –  chiastic-security Sep 12 '14 at 18:14

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;
}

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

I don't see it mentioned yet in the other answers so far. But if "Best" means speed, then the new Java I/O (NIO) might provide the fastest preformance, but not always the easiest to figure out for someone learning.

Probably not as fast as with buffered IO but quite terse:

    String content;
    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(textFile).useDelimiter("\\Z")) {
        content = scanner.next();
    }
The \Z pattern tells the Scanner that the delimiter is EOF

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}
PS : Don't forget to import java.util.*; for Scanner to work.

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

Much faster than what? It most certainly is not faster than appending to a StringBuffer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:02

@gb96 I thought the same about buffer sizes, but the detailed experiment in this question gave surprising results in a similar context: a 16KB buffer was consistently and noticeably faster. –  chiastic-security Sep 12 '14 at 18:14

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

ASCII is a TEXT file so you would use Readers for reading. Java also supports reading from a binary file using InputStreams. If the files being read are huge then you would want to use a BufferedReader on top of a FileReader to improve read performance.

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02
1	 	
Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception

        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)

            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

Much faster than what? It most certainly is not faster than appending to a StringBuffer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:02

@gb96 I thought the same about buffer sizes, but the detailed experiment in this question gave surprising results in a similar context: a 16KB buffer was consistently and noticeably faster. –  chiastic-security Sep 12 '14 at 18:14

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

ASCII is a TEXT file so you would use Readers for reading. Java also supports reading from a binary file using InputStreams. If the files being read are huge then you would want to use a BufferedReader on top of a FileReader to improve read performance.

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02
1	 	
Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

I've made a small adjustment to stop adding a newline ( \n ) if the last line is reached. code while (line != null) { sb.append(line); line = br.readLine(); // Only add new line when curline is NOT the last line.. if(line != null) { sb.append("\n"); } }code –  Ramon Fincken Apr 16 '13 at 11:07

I feel it is better to explicitly give the encoding option and use the FileInputStream rather than directly the FileReader ? See this question too stackoverflow.com/questions/696626/… `reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("<filePath>", "UTF-8"); –  Alex Punnen Jun 4 '13 at 6:43

Similar to Apache Common IO IOUtils#toString() is sun.misc.IOUtils#readFully(), which is included in the Sun/Oracle JREs. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:55

For performance always call sb.append('\n') in preference to sb.append("\n") as a char is appended to the StringBuilder faster than a String –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:58

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41
3	 	
I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

Much faster than what? It most certainly is not faster than appending to a StringBuffer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:02

@gb96 I thought the same about buffer sizes, but the detailed experiment in this question gave surprising results in a similar context: a 16KB buffer was consistently and noticeably faster. –  chiastic-security Sep 12 '14 at 18:14

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

ASCII is a TEXT file so you would use Readers for reading. Java also supports reading from a binary file using InputStreams. If the files being read are huge then you would want to use a BufferedReader on top of a FileReader to improve read performance.

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02

Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }

The methods within org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils may also be very handy, e.g.:

/**
 * Reads the contents of a file line by line to a List
 * of Strings using the default encoding for the VM.
 */
static List readLines(File file)

Or if you prefer Guava (a more modern, actively maintained library), it has similar utilities in its Files class. Simple examples in this answer. –  Jonik Dec 29 '13 at 13:26 
  	 	
or you simply use the built in method to get all lines: docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:50

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

I don't see it mentioned yet in the other answers so far. But if "Best" means speed, then the new Java I/O (NIO) might provide the fastest preformance, but not always the easiest to figure out for someone learning.

Probably not as fast as with buffered IO but quite terse:

    String content;
    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(textFile).useDelimiter("\\Z")) {
        content = scanner.next();
    }
The \Z pattern tells the Scanner that the delimiter is EOF

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}
PS : Don't forget to import java.util.*; for Scanner to work.

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;
}

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

I don't see it mentioned yet in the other answers so far. But if "Best" means speed, then the new Java I/O (NIO) might provide the fastest preformance, but not always the easiest to figure out for someone learning.

Probably not as fast as with buffered IO but quite terse:

    String content;
    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(textFile).useDelimiter("\\Z")) {
        content = scanner.next();
    }
The \Z pattern tells the Scanner that the delimiter is EOF

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}
PS : Don't forget to import java.util.*; for Scanner to work.

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

Much faster than what? It most certainly is not faster than appending to a StringBuffer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:02

@gb96 I thought the same about buffer sizes, but the detailed experiment in this question gave surprising results in a similar context: a 16KB buffer was consistently and noticeably faster. –  chiastic-security Sep 12 '14 at 18:14

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

ASCII is a TEXT file so you would use Readers for reading. Java also supports reading from a binary file using InputStreams. If the files being read are huge then you would want to use a BufferedReader on top of a FileReader to improve read performance.

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02
1	 	
Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception

    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception

        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41
3	 	
I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

Much faster than what? It most certainly is not faster than appending to a StringBuffer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:02

@gb96 I thought the same about buffer sizes, but the detailed experiment in this question gave surprising results in a similar context: a 16KB buffer was consistently and noticeably faster. –  chiastic-security Sep 12 '14 at 18:14

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

ASCII is a TEXT file so you would use Readers for reading. Java also supports reading from a binary file using InputStreams. If the files being read are huge then you would want to use a BufferedReader on top of a FileReader to improve read performance.

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02
1	 	
Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

I've made a small adjustment to stop adding a newline ( \n ) if the last line is reached. code while (line != null) { sb.append(line); line = br.readLine(); // Only add new line when curline is NOT the last line.. if(line != null) { sb.append("\n"); } }code –  Ramon Fincken Apr 16 '13 at 11:07

I feel it is better to explicitly give the encoding option and use the FileInputStream rather than directly the FileReader ? See this question too stackoverflow.com/questions/696626/… `reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("<filePath>", "UTF-8"); –  Alex Punnen Jun 4 '13 at 6:43

Similar to Apache Common IO IOUtils#toString() is sun.misc.IOUtils#readFully(), which is included in the Sun/Oracle JREs. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:55

For performance always call sb.append('\n') in preference to sb.append("\n") as a char is appended to the StringBuilder faster than a String –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:58

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

I also disagree with closing as "not constructive". Fortunately, this could well be closed as duplicate.

ASCII is a TEXT file so you would use Readers for reading. Java also supports reading from a binary file using InputStreams. If the files being read are huge then you would want to use a BufferedReader on top of a FileReader to improve read performance.

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02
1	 	
Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

I've made a small adjustment to stop adding a newline ( \n ) if the last line is reached. code while (line != null) { sb.append(line); line = br.readLine(); // Only add new line when curline is NOT the last line.. if(line != null) { sb.append("\n"); } }code –  Ramon Fincken Apr 16 '13 at 11:07

I feel it is better to explicitly give the encoding option and use the FileInputStream rather than directly the FileReader ? See this question too stackoverflow.com/questions/696626/… `reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("<filePath>", "UTF-8"); –  Alex Punnen Jun 4 '13 at 6:43

Similar to Apache Common IO IOUtils#toString() is sun.misc.IOUtils#readFully(), which is included in the Sun/Oracle JREs. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:55

For performance always call sb.append('\n') in preference to sb.append("\n") as a char is appended to the StringBuilder faster than a String –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:58

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;
}

This technique assumes that read() fills the buffer; that the number of chars equals the number of bytes; that the number of bytes fits into memory; and that the number of bytes fits into an integer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:01

The methods within org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils may also be very handy, e.g.:

/**
 * Reads the contents of a file line by line to a List
 * of Strings using the default encoding for the VM.

static List readLines(File file)

Or if you prefer Guava (a more modern, actively maintained library), it has similar utilities in its Files class. Simple examples in this answer. –  Jonik Dec 29 '13 at 13:26 
  	 	
or you simply use the built in method to get all lines: docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:50

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

Unfortunately, nowadays there is no readLines(String) and readLines(File) is deprecated in favor of readLines(File, Charset). The encoding can be supplied also as a string. –  Palec Feb 15 at 11:46

I don't see it mentioned yet in the other answers so far. But if "Best" means speed, then the new Java I/O (NIO) might provide the fastest preformance, but not always the easiest to figure out for someone learning.

Probably not as fast as with buffered IO but quite terse:

    String content;
    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(textFile).useDelimiter("\\Z")) {
        content = scanner.next();
    }
The \Z pattern tells the Scanner that the delimiter is EOF

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}
PS : Don't forget to import java.util.*; for Scanner to work.

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02

Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

I've made a small adjustment to stop adding a newline ( \n ) if the last line is reached. code while (line != null) { sb.append(line); line = br.readLine(); // Only add new line when curline is NOT the last line.. if(line != null) { sb.append("\n"); } }code –  Ramon Fincken Apr 16 '13 at 11:07

I feel it is better to explicitly give the encoding option and use the FileInputStream rather than directly the FileReader ? See this question too stackoverflow.com/questions/696626/… `reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("<filePath>", "UTF-8"); –  Alex Punnen Jun 4 '13 at 6:43

Similar to Apache Common IO IOUtils#toString() is sun.misc.IOUtils#readFully(), which is included in the Sun/Oracle JREs. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:55

For performance always call sb.append('\n') in preference to sb.append("\n") as a char is appended to the StringBuilder faster than a String –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:58

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;
}

This technique assumes that read() fills the buffer; that the number of chars equals the number of bytes; that the number of bytes fits into memory; and that the number of bytes fits into an integer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:01

The methods within org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils may also be very handy, e.g.:

/**
 * Reads the contents of a file line by line to a List
 * of Strings using the default encoding for the VM.
 */
static List readLines(File file)

Or if you prefer Guava (a more modern, actively maintained library), it has similar utilities in its Files class. Simple examples in this answer. –  Jonik Dec 29 '13 at 13:26

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

I don't see it mentioned yet in the other answers so far. But if "Best" means speed, then the new Java I/O (NIO) might provide the fastest preformance, but not always the easiest to figure out for someone learning.

Probably not as fast as with buffered IO but quite terse:

    String content;
    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(textFile).useDelimiter("\\Z")) {
        content = scanner.next();
    }
The \Z pattern tells the Scanner that the delimiter is EOF

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}
PS : Don't forget to import java.util.*; for Scanner to work.

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

Much faster than what? It most certainly is not faster than appending to a StringBuffer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:02

@gb96 I thought the same about buffer sizes, but the detailed experiment in this question gave surprising results in a similar context: a 16KB buffer was consistently and noticeably faster. –  chiastic-security Sep 12 '14 at 18:14

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;
}

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

I don't see it mentioned yet in the other answers so far. But if "Best" means speed, then the new Java I/O (NIO) might provide the fastest preformance, but not always the easiest to figure out for someone learning.

Probably not as fast as with buffered IO but quite terse:

    String content;
    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(textFile).useDelimiter("\\Z")) {
        content = scanner.next();
    }
The \Z pattern tells the Scanner that the delimiter is EOF

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}
PS : Don't forget to import java.util.*; for Scanner to work.

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

Much faster than what? It most certainly is not faster than appending to a StringBuffer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:02

@gb96 I thought the same about buffer sizes, but the detailed experiment in this question gave surprising results in a similar context: a 16KB buffer was consistently and noticeably faster. –  chiastic-security Sep 12 '14 at 18:14

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

ASCII is a TEXT file so you would use Readers for reading. Java also supports reading from a binary file using InputStreams. If the files being read are huge then you would want to use a BufferedReader on top of a FileReader to improve read performance.

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02
1	 	
Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception

        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)

            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

Much faster than what? It most certainly is not faster than appending to a StringBuffer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:02

@gb96 I thought the same about buffer sizes, but the detailed experiment in this question gave surprising results in a similar context: a 16KB buffer was consistently and noticeably faster. –  chiastic-security Sep 12 '14 at 18:14

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

ASCII is a TEXT file so you would use Readers for reading. Java also supports reading from a binary file using InputStreams. If the files being read are huge then you would want to use a BufferedReader on top of a FileReader to improve read performance.

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02
1	 	
Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

I've made a small adjustment to stop adding a newline ( \n ) if the last line is reached. code while (line != null) { sb.append(line); line = br.readLine(); // Only add new line when curline is NOT the last line.. if(line != null) { sb.append("\n"); } }code –  Ramon Fincken Apr 16 '13 at 11:07

I feel it is better to explicitly give the encoding option and use the FileInputStream rather than directly the FileReader ? See this question too stackoverflow.com/questions/696626/… `reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("<filePath>", "UTF-8"); –  Alex Punnen Jun 4 '13 at 6:43

Similar to Apache Common IO IOUtils#toString() is sun.misc.IOUtils#readFully(), which is included in the Sun/Oracle JREs. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:55

For performance always call sb.append('\n') in preference to sb.append("\n") as a char is appended to the StringBuilder faster than a String –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:58

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

I also disagree with closing as "not constructive". Fortunately, this could well be closed as duplicate.

ASCII is a TEXT file so you would use Readers for reading. Java also supports reading from a binary file using InputStreams. If the files being read are huge then you would want to use a BufferedReader on top of a FileReader to improve read performance.

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02
1	 	
Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

I've made a small adjustment to stop adding a newline ( \n ) if the last line is reached. code while (line != null) { sb.append(line); line = br.readLine(); // Only add new line when curline is NOT the last line.. if(line != null) { sb.append("\n"); } }code –  Ramon Fincken Apr 16 '13 at 11:07

I feel it is better to explicitly give the encoding option and use the FileInputStream rather than directly the FileReader ? See this question too stackoverflow.com/questions/696626/… `reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("<filePath>", "UTF-8"); –  Alex Punnen Jun 4 '13 at 6:43

Similar to Apache Common IO IOUtils#toString() is sun.misc.IOUtils#readFully(), which is included in the Sun/Oracle JREs. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:55

For performance always call sb.append('\n') in preference to sb.append("\n") as a char is appended to the StringBuilder faster than a String –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:58

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;
}

This technique assumes that read() fills the buffer; that the number of chars equals the number of bytes; that the number of bytes fits into memory; and that the number of bytes fits into an integer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:01

The methods within org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils may also be very handy, e.g.:

/**
 * Reads the contents of a file line by line to a List
 * of Strings using the default encoding for the VM.

static List readLines(File file)

Or if you prefer Guava (a more modern, actively maintained library), it has similar utilities in its Files class. Simple examples in this answer. –  Jonik Dec 29 '13 at 13:26 
  	 	
or you simply use the built in method to get all lines: docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:50

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

Unfortunately, nowadays there is no readLines(String) and readLines(File) is deprecated in favor of readLines(File, Charset). The encoding can be supplied also as a string. –  Palec Feb 15 at 11:46

I don't see it mentioned yet in the other answers so far. But if "Best" means speed, then the new Java I/O (NIO) might provide the fastest preformance, but not always the easiest to figure out for someone learning.

Probably not as fast as with buffered IO but quite terse:

    String content;
    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(textFile).useDelimiter("\\Z")) {
        content = scanner.next();
    }
The \Z pattern tells the Scanner that the delimiter is EOF

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}
PS : Don't forget to import java.util.*; for Scanner to work.

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02

Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

I've made a small adjustment to stop adding a newline ( \n ) if the last line is reached. code while (line != null) { sb.append(line); line = br.readLine(); // Only add new line when curline is NOT the last line.. if(line != null) { sb.append("\n"); } }code –  Ramon Fincken Apr 16 '13 at 11:07

I feel it is better to explicitly give the encoding option and use the FileInputStream rather than directly the FileReader ? See this question too stackoverflow.com/questions/696626/… `reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("<filePath>", "UTF-8"); –  Alex Punnen Jun 4 '13 at 6:43

Similar to Apache Common IO IOUtils#toString() is sun.misc.IOUtils#readFully(), which is included in the Sun/Oracle JREs. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:55

For performance always call sb.append('\n') in preference to sb.append("\n") as a char is appended to the StringBuilder faster than a String –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:58

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;
}

This technique assumes that read() fills the buffer; that the number of chars equals the number of bytes; that the number of bytes fits into memory; and that the number of bytes fits into an integer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:01

The methods within org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils may also be very handy, e.g.:

/**
 * Reads the contents of a file line by line to a List
 * of Strings using the default encoding for the VM.
 */
static List readLines(File file)

Or if you prefer Guava (a more modern, actively maintained library), it has similar utilities in its Files class. Simple examples in this answer. –  Jonik Dec 29 '13 at 13:26

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

I don't see it mentioned yet in the other answers so far. But if "Best" means speed, then the new Java I/O (NIO) might provide the fastest preformance, but not always the easiest to figure out for someone learning.

Probably not as fast as with buffered IO but quite terse:

    String content;
    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(textFile).useDelimiter("\\Z")) {
        content = scanner.next();
    }
The \Z pattern tells the Scanner that the delimiter is EOF

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}
PS : Don't forget to import java.util.*; for Scanner to work.

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

Much faster than what? It most certainly is not faster than appending to a StringBuffer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:02

@gb96 I thought the same about buffer sizes, but the detailed experiment in this question gave surprising results in a similar context: a 16KB buffer was consistently and noticeably faster. –  chiastic-security Sep 12 '14 at 18:14

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;
}

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

I don't see it mentioned yet in the other answers so far. But if "Best" means speed, then the new Java I/O (NIO) might provide the fastest preformance, but not always the easiest to figure out for someone learning.

Probably not as fast as with buffered IO but quite terse:

    String content;
    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(textFile).useDelimiter("\\Z")) {
        content = scanner.next();
    }
The \Z pattern tells the Scanner that the delimiter is EOF

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}
PS : Don't forget to import java.util.*; for Scanner to work.

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

Much faster than what? It most certainly is not faster than appending to a StringBuffer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:02

@gb96 I thought the same about buffer sizes, but the detailed experiment in this question gave surprising results in a similar context: a 16KB buffer was consistently and noticeably faster. –  chiastic-security Sep 12 '14 at 18:14

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

ASCII is a TEXT file so you would use Readers for reading. Java also supports reading from a binary file using InputStreams. If the files being read are huge then you would want to use a BufferedReader on top of a FileReader to improve read performance.

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02
1	 	
Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception

        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)

            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

Much faster than what? It most certainly is not faster than appending to a StringBuffer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:02

@gb96 I thought the same about buffer sizes, but the detailed experiment in this question gave surprising results in a similar context: a 16KB buffer was consistently and noticeably faster. –  chiastic-security Sep 12 '14 at 18:14

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

ASCII is a TEXT file so you would use Readers for reading. Java also supports reading from a binary file using InputStreams. If the files being read are huge then you would want to use a BufferedReader on top of a FileReader to improve read performance.

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02
1	 	
Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

I've made a small adjustment to stop adding a newline ( \n ) if the last line is reached. code while (line != null) { sb.append(line); line = br.readLine(); // Only add new line when curline is NOT the last line.. if(line != null) { sb.append("\n"); } }code –  Ramon Fincken Apr 16 '13 at 11:07

I feel it is better to explicitly give the encoding option and use the FileInputStream rather than directly the FileReader ? See this question too stackoverflow.com/questions/696626/… `reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("<filePath>", "UTF-8"); –  Alex Punnen Jun 4 '13 at 6:43

Similar to Apache Common IO IOUtils#toString() is sun.misc.IOUtils#readFully(), which is included in the Sun/Oracle JREs. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:55

For performance always call sb.append('\n') in preference to sb.append("\n") as a char is appended to the StringBuilder faster than a String –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:58

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

I also disagree with closing as "not constructive". Fortunately, this could well be closed as duplicate.

ASCII is a TEXT file so you would use Readers for reading. Java also supports reading from a binary file using InputStreams. If the files being read are huge then you would want to use a BufferedReader on top of a FileReader to improve read performance.

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02
1	 	
Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

I've made a small adjustment to stop adding a newline ( \n ) if the last line is reached. code while (line != null) { sb.append(line); line = br.readLine(); // Only add new line when curline is NOT the last line.. if(line != null) { sb.append("\n"); } }code –  Ramon Fincken Apr 16 '13 at 11:07

I feel it is better to explicitly give the encoding option and use the FileInputStream rather than directly the FileReader ? See this question too stackoverflow.com/questions/696626/… `reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("<filePath>", "UTF-8"); –  Alex Punnen Jun 4 '13 at 6:43

Similar to Apache Common IO IOUtils#toString() is sun.misc.IOUtils#readFully(), which is included in the Sun/Oracle JREs. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:55

For performance always call sb.append('\n') in preference to sb.append("\n") as a char is appended to the StringBuilder faster than a String –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:58

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;
}

This technique assumes that read() fills the buffer; that the number of chars equals the number of bytes; that the number of bytes fits into memory; and that the number of bytes fits into an integer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:01

The methods within org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils may also be very handy, e.g.:

/**
 * Reads the contents of a file line by line to a List
 * of Strings using the default encoding for the VM.

static List readLines(File file)

Or if you prefer Guava (a more modern, actively maintained library), it has similar utilities in its Files class. Simple examples in this answer. –  Jonik Dec 29 '13 at 13:26 
  	 	
or you simply use the built in method to get all lines: docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:50

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

Unfortunately, nowadays there is no readLines(String) and readLines(File) is deprecated in favor of readLines(File, Charset). The encoding can be supplied also as a string. –  Palec Feb 15 at 11:46

I don't see it mentioned yet in the other answers so far. But if "Best" means speed, then the new Java I/O (NIO) might provide the fastest preformance, but not always the easiest to figure out for someone learning.

Probably not as fast as with buffered IO but quite terse:

    String content;
    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(textFile).useDelimiter("\\Z")) {
        content = scanner.next();
    }
The \Z pattern tells the Scanner that the delimiter is EOF

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}
PS : Don't forget to import java.util.*; for Scanner to work.

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02

Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

I've made a small adjustment to stop adding a newline ( \n ) if the last line is reached. code while (line != null) { sb.append(line); line = br.readLine(); // Only add new line when curline is NOT the last line.. if(line != null) { sb.append("\n"); } }code –  Ramon Fincken Apr 16 '13 at 11:07

I feel it is better to explicitly give the encoding option and use the FileInputStream rather than directly the FileReader ? See this question too stackoverflow.com/questions/696626/… `reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("<filePath>", "UTF-8"); –  Alex Punnen Jun 4 '13 at 6:43

Similar to Apache Common IO IOUtils#toString() is sun.misc.IOUtils#readFully(), which is included in the Sun/Oracle JREs. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:55

For performance always call sb.append('\n') in preference to sb.append("\n") as a char is appended to the StringBuilder faster than a String –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:58

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;
}

This technique assumes that read() fills the buffer; that the number of chars equals the number of bytes; that the number of bytes fits into memory; and that the number of bytes fits into an integer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:01

The methods within org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils may also be very handy, e.g.:

/**

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

I don't see it mentioned yet in the other answers so far. But if "Best" means speed, then the new Java I/O (NIO) might provide the fastest preformance, but not always the easiest to figure out for someone learning.

Probably not as fast as with buffered IO but quite terse:

    String content;
    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(textFile).useDelimiter("\\Z")) {
        content = scanner.next();
    }
The \Z pattern tells the Scanner that the delimiter is EOF

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}
PS : Don't forget to import java.util.*; for Scanner to work.

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

Much faster than what? It most certainly is not faster than appending to a StringBuffer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:02

@gb96 I thought the same about buffer sizes, but the detailed experiment in this question gave surprising results in a similar context: a 16KB buffer was consistently and noticeably faster. –  chiastic-security Sep 12 '14 at 18:14

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception

    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception

        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41
3	 	
I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

Much faster than what? It most certainly is not faster than appending to a StringBuffer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:02

@gb96 I thought the same about buffer sizes, but the detailed experiment in this question gave surprising results in a similar context: a 16KB buffer was consistently and noticeably faster. –  chiastic-security Sep 12 '14 at 18:14

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

ASCII is a TEXT file so you would use Readers for reading. Java also supports reading from a binary file using InputStreams. If the files being read are huge then you would want to use a BufferedReader on top of a FileReader to improve read performance.

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02
1	 	
Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

I've made a small adjustment to stop adding a newline ( \n ) if the last line is reached. code while (line != null) { sb.append(line); line = br.readLine(); // Only add new line when curline is NOT the last line.. if(line != null) { sb.append("\n"); } }code –  Ramon Fincken Apr 16 '13 at 11:07

I feel it is better to explicitly give the encoding option and use the FileInputStream rather than directly the FileReader ? See this question too stackoverflow.com/questions/696626/… `reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("<filePath>", "UTF-8"); –  Alex Punnen Jun 4 '13 at 6:43

Similar to Apache Common IO IOUtils#toString() is sun.misc.IOUtils#readFully(), which is included in the Sun/Oracle JREs. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:55

For performance always call sb.append('\n') in preference to sb.append("\n") as a char is appended to the StringBuilder faster than a String –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:58

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

I also disagree with closing as "not constructive". Fortunately, this could well be closed as duplicate.

ASCII is a TEXT file so you would use Readers for reading. Java also supports reading from a binary file using InputStreams. If the files being read are huge then you would want to use a BufferedReader on top of a FileReader to improve read performance.

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02
1	 	
Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

I've made a small adjustment to stop adding a newline ( \n ) if the last line is reached. code while (line != null) { sb.append(line); line = br.readLine(); // Only add new line when curline is NOT the last line.. if(line != null) { sb.append("\n"); } }code –  Ramon Fincken Apr 16 '13 at 11:07

I feel it is better to explicitly give the encoding option and use the FileInputStream rather than directly the FileReader ? See this question too stackoverflow.com/questions/696626/… `reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("<filePath>", "UTF-8"); –  Alex Punnen Jun 4 '13 at 6:43

Similar to Apache Common IO IOUtils#toString() is sun.misc.IOUtils#readFully(), which is included in the Sun/Oracle JREs. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:55

For performance always call sb.append('\n') in preference to sb.append("\n") as a char is appended to the StringBuilder faster than a String –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:58

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;
}

This technique assumes that read() fills the buffer; that the number of chars equals the number of bytes; that the number of bytes fits into memory; and that the number of bytes fits into an integer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:01

The methods within org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils may also be very handy, e.g.:

/**
 * Reads the contents of a file line by line to a List
 * of Strings using the default encoding for the VM.

static List readLines(File file)

Or if you prefer Guava (a more modern, actively maintained library), it has similar utilities in its Files class. Simple examples in this answer. –  Jonik Dec 29 '13 at 13:26 
  	 	
or you simply use the built in method to get all lines: docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:50

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

Unfortunately, nowadays there is no readLines(String) and readLines(File) is deprecated in favor of readLines(File, Charset). The encoding can be supplied also as a string. –  Palec Feb 15 at 11:46

I don't see it mentioned yet in the other answers so far. But if "Best" means speed, then the new Java I/O (NIO) might provide the fastest preformance, but not always the easiest to figure out for someone learning.

Probably not as fast as with buffered IO but quite terse:

    String content;
    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(textFile).useDelimiter("\\Z")) {
        content = scanner.next();
    }
The \Z pattern tells the Scanner that the delimiter is EOF

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}
PS : Don't forget to import java.util.*; for Scanner to work.

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02

Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

I've made a small adjustment to stop adding a newline ( \n ) if the last line is reached. code while (line != null) { sb.append(line); line = br.readLine(); // Only add new line when curline is NOT the last line.. if(line != null) { sb.append("\n"); } }code –  Ramon Fincken Apr 16 '13 at 11:07

I feel it is better to explicitly give the encoding option and use the FileInputStream rather than directly the FileReader ? See this question too stackoverflow.com/questions/696626/… `reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("<filePath>", "UTF-8"); –  Alex Punnen Jun 4 '13 at 6:43

Similar to Apache Common IO IOUtils#toString() is sun.misc.IOUtils#readFully(), which is included in the Sun/Oracle JREs. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:55

For performance always call sb.append('\n') in preference to sb.append("\n") as a char is appended to the StringBuilder faster than a String –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:58

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;
}

This technique assumes that read() fills the buffer; that the number of chars equals the number of bytes; that the number of bytes fits into memory; and that the number of bytes fits into an integer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:01

The methods within org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils may also be very handy, e.g.:

/**
 * Reads the contents of a file line by line to a List
 * of Strings using the default encoding for the VM.
 */
static List readLines(File file)

Or if you prefer Guava (a more modern, actively maintained library), it has similar utilities in its Files class. Simple examples in this answer. –  Jonik Dec 29 '13 at 13:26

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

I don't see it mentioned yet in the other answers so far. But if "Best" means speed, then the new Java I/O (NIO) might provide the fastest preformance, but not always the easiest to figure out for someone learning.

Probably not as fast as with buffered IO but quite terse:

    String content;
    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(textFile).useDelimiter("\\Z")) {
        content = scanner.next();
    }
The \Z pattern tells the Scanner that the delimiter is EOF

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}
PS : Don't forget to import java.util.*; for Scanner to work.

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

Much faster than what? It most certainly is not faster than appending to a StringBuffer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:02

@gb96 I thought the same about buffer sizes, but the detailed experiment in this question gave surprising results in a similar context: a 16KB buffer was consistently and noticeably faster. –  chiastic-security Sep 12 '14 at 18:14

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;
}

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

I don't see it mentioned yet in the other answers so far. But if "Best" means speed, then the new Java I/O (NIO) might provide the fastest preformance, but not always the easiest to figure out for someone learning.

Probably not as fast as with buffered IO but quite terse:

    String content;
    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(textFile).useDelimiter("\\Z")) {
        content = scanner.next();
    }
The \Z pattern tells the Scanner that the delimiter is EOF

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}
PS : Don't forget to import java.util.*; for Scanner to work.

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

Much faster than what? It most certainly is not faster than appending to a StringBuffer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:02

@gb96 I thought the same about buffer sizes, but the detailed experiment in this question gave surprising results in a similar context: a 16KB buffer was consistently and noticeably faster. –  chiastic-security Sep 12 '14 at 18:14

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

ASCII is a TEXT file so you would use Readers for reading. Java also supports reading from a binary file using InputStreams. If the files being read are huge then you would want to use a BufferedReader on top of a FileReader to improve read performance.

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02
1	 	
Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception

        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)

            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

Much faster than what? It most certainly is not faster than appending to a StringBuffer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:02

@gb96 I thought the same about buffer sizes, but the detailed experiment in this question gave surprising results in a similar context: a 16KB buffer was consistently and noticeably faster. –  chiastic-security Sep 12 '14 at 18:14

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

ASCII is a TEXT file so you would use Readers for reading. Java also supports reading from a binary file using InputStreams. If the files being read are huge then you would want to use a BufferedReader on top of a FileReader to improve read performance.

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02
1	 	
Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

I've made a small adjustment to stop adding a newline ( \n ) if the last line is reached. code while (line != null) { sb.append(line); line = br.readLine(); // Only add new line when curline is NOT the last line.. if(line != null) { sb.append("\n"); } }code –  Ramon Fincken Apr 16 '13 at 11:07

I feel it is better to explicitly give the encoding option and use the FileInputStream rather than directly the FileReader ? See this question too stackoverflow.com/questions/696626/… `reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("<filePath>", "UTF-8"); –  Alex Punnen Jun 4 '13 at 6:43

Similar to Apache Common IO IOUtils#toString() is sun.misc.IOUtils#readFully(), which is included in the Sun/Oracle JREs. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:55

For performance always call sb.append('\n') in preference to sb.append("\n") as a char is appended to the StringBuilder faster than a String –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:58

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

I also disagree with closing as "not constructive". Fortunately, this could well be closed as duplicate.

ASCII is a TEXT file so you would use Readers for reading. Java also supports reading from a binary file using InputStreams. If the files being read are huge then you would want to use a BufferedReader on top of a FileReader to improve read performance.

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02
1	 	
Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

I've made a small adjustment to stop adding a newline ( \n ) if the last line is reached. code while (line != null) { sb.append(line); line = br.readLine(); // Only add new line when curline is NOT the last line.. if(line != null) { sb.append("\n"); } }code –  Ramon Fincken Apr 16 '13 at 11:07

I feel it is better to explicitly give the encoding option and use the FileInputStream rather than directly the FileReader ? See this question too stackoverflow.com/questions/696626/… `reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("<filePath>", "UTF-8"); –  Alex Punnen Jun 4 '13 at 6:43

Similar to Apache Common IO IOUtils#toString() is sun.misc.IOUtils#readFully(), which is included in the Sun/Oracle JREs. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:55

For performance always call sb.append('\n') in preference to sb.append("\n") as a char is appended to the StringBuilder faster than a String –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:58

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;
}

This technique assumes that read() fills the buffer; that the number of chars equals the number of bytes; that the number of bytes fits into memory; and that the number of bytes fits into an integer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:01

The methods within org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils may also be very handy, e.g.:

/**
 * Reads the contents of a file line by line to a List
 * of Strings using the default encoding for the VM.

static List readLines(File file)

Or if you prefer Guava (a more modern, actively maintained library), it has similar utilities in its Files class. Simple examples in this answer. –  Jonik Dec 29 '13 at 13:26 
  	 	
or you simply use the built in method to get all lines: docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:50

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

Unfortunately, nowadays there is no readLines(String) and readLines(File) is deprecated in favor of readLines(File, Charset). The encoding can be supplied also as a string. –  Palec Feb 15 at 11:46

I don't see it mentioned yet in the other answers so far. But if "Best" means speed, then the new Java I/O (NIO) might provide the fastest preformance, but not always the easiest to figure out for someone learning.

Probably not as fast as with buffered IO but quite terse:

    String content;
    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(textFile).useDelimiter("\\Z")) {
        content = scanner.next();
    }
The \Z pattern tells the Scanner that the delimiter is EOF

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}
PS : Don't forget to import java.util.*; for Scanner to work.

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02

Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

I've made a small adjustment to stop adding a newline ( \n ) if the last line is reached. code while (line != null) { sb.append(line); line = br.readLine(); // Only add new line when curline is NOT the last line.. if(line != null) { sb.append("\n"); } }code –  Ramon Fincken Apr 16 '13 at 11:07

I feel it is better to explicitly give the encoding option and use the FileInputStream rather than directly the FileReader ? See this question too stackoverflow.com/questions/696626/… `reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("<filePath>", "UTF-8"); –  Alex Punnen Jun 4 '13 at 6:43

Similar to Apache Common IO IOUtils#toString() is sun.misc.IOUtils#readFully(), which is included in the Sun/Oracle JREs. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:55

For performance always call sb.append('\n') in preference to sb.append("\n") as a char is appended to the StringBuilder faster than a String –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:58

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;
}

This technique assumes that read() fills the buffer; that the number of chars equals the number of bytes; that the number of bytes fits into memory; and that the number of bytes fits into an integer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:01

The methods within org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils may also be very handy, e.g.:

/**
 * Reads the contents of a file line by line to a List
 * of Strings using the default encoding for the VM.
 */
static List readLines(File file)

Or if you prefer Guava (a more modern, actively maintained library), it has similar utilities in its Files class. Simple examples in this answer. –  Jonik Dec 29 '13 at 13:26

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

I don't see it mentioned yet in the other answers so far. But if "Best" means speed, then the new Java I/O (NIO) might provide the fastest preformance, but not always the easiest to figure out for someone learning.

Probably not as fast as with buffered IO but quite terse:

    String content;
    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(textFile).useDelimiter("\\Z")) {
        content = scanner.next();
    }
The \Z pattern tells the Scanner that the delimiter is EOF

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}
PS : Don't forget to import java.util.*; for Scanner to work.

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

Much faster than what? It most certainly is not faster than appending to a StringBuffer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:02

@gb96 I thought the same about buffer sizes, but the detailed experiment in this question gave surprising results in a similar context: a 16KB buffer was consistently and noticeably faster. –  chiastic-security Sep 12 '14 at 18:14

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;
}

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

I don't see it mentioned yet in the other answers so far. But if "Best" means speed, then the new Java I/O (NIO) might provide the fastest preformance, but not always the easiest to figure out for someone learning.

Probably not as fast as with buffered IO but quite terse:

    String content;
    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(textFile).useDelimiter("\\Z")) {
        content = scanner.next();
    }
The \Z pattern tells the Scanner that the delimiter is EOF

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}
PS : Don't forget to import java.util.*; for Scanner to work.

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

Much faster than what? It most certainly is not faster than appending to a StringBuffer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:02

@gb96 I thought the same about buffer sizes, but the detailed experiment in this question gave surprising results in a similar context: a 16KB buffer was consistently and noticeably faster. –  chiastic-security Sep 12 '14 at 18:14

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

ASCII is a TEXT file so you would use Readers for reading. Java also supports reading from a binary file using InputStreams. If the files being read are huge then you would want to use a BufferedReader on top of a FileReader to improve read performance.

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02
1	 	
Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception

        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)

            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

Much faster than what? It most certainly is not faster than appending to a StringBuffer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:02

@gb96 I thought the same about buffer sizes, but the detailed experiment in this question gave surprising results in a similar context: a 16KB buffer was consistently and noticeably faster. –  chiastic-security Sep 12 '14 at 18:14

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

ASCII is a TEXT file so you would use Readers for reading. Java also supports reading from a binary file using InputStreams. If the files being read are huge then you would want to use a BufferedReader on top of a FileReader to improve read performance.

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02
1	 	
Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

I've made a small adjustment to stop adding a newline ( \n ) if the last line is reached. code while (line != null) { sb.append(line); line = br.readLine(); // Only add new line when curline is NOT the last line.. if(line != null) { sb.append("\n"); } }code –  Ramon Fincken Apr 16 '13 at 11:07

I feel it is better to explicitly give the encoding option and use the FileInputStream rather than directly the FileReader ? See this question too stackoverflow.com/questions/696626/… `reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("<filePath>", "UTF-8"); –  Alex Punnen Jun 4 '13 at 6:43

Similar to Apache Common IO IOUtils#toString() is sun.misc.IOUtils#readFully(), which is included in the Sun/Oracle JREs. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:55

For performance always call sb.append('\n') in preference to sb.append("\n") as a char is appended to the StringBuilder faster than a String –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:58

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

I also disagree with closing as "not constructive". Fortunately, this could well be closed as duplicate.

ASCII is a TEXT file so you would use Readers for reading. Java also supports reading from a binary file using InputStreams. If the files being read are huge then you would want to use a BufferedReader on top of a FileReader to improve read performance.

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02
1	 	
Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

I've made a small adjustment to stop adding a newline ( \n ) if the last line is reached. code while (line != null) { sb.append(line); line = br.readLine(); // Only add new line when curline is NOT the last line.. if(line != null) { sb.append("\n"); } }code –  Ramon Fincken Apr 16 '13 at 11:07

I feel it is better to explicitly give the encoding option and use the FileInputStream rather than directly the FileReader ? See this question too stackoverflow.com/questions/696626/… `reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("<filePath>", "UTF-8"); –  Alex Punnen Jun 4 '13 at 6:43

Similar to Apache Common IO IOUtils#toString() is sun.misc.IOUtils#readFully(), which is included in the Sun/Oracle JREs. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:55

For performance always call sb.append('\n') in preference to sb.append("\n") as a char is appended to the StringBuilder faster than a String –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:58

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;
}

This technique assumes that read() fills the buffer; that the number of chars equals the number of bytes; that the number of bytes fits into memory; and that the number of bytes fits into an integer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:01

The methods within org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils may also be very handy, e.g.:

/**
 * Reads the contents of a file line by line to a List
 * of Strings using the default encoding for the VM.

static List readLines(File file)

Or if you prefer Guava (a more modern, actively maintained library), it has similar utilities in its Files class. Simple examples in this answer. –  Jonik Dec 29 '13 at 13:26 
  	 	
or you simply use the built in method to get all lines: docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:50

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

Unfortunately, nowadays there is no readLines(String) and readLines(File) is deprecated in favor of readLines(File, Charset). The encoding can be supplied also as a string. –  Palec Feb 15 at 11:46

I don't see it mentioned yet in the other answers so far. But if "Best" means speed, then the new Java I/O (NIO) might provide the fastest preformance, but not always the easiest to figure out for someone learning.

Probably not as fast as with buffered IO but quite terse:

    String content;
    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(textFile).useDelimiter("\\Z")) {
        content = scanner.next();
    }
The \Z pattern tells the Scanner that the delimiter is EOF

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}
PS : Don't forget to import java.util.*; for Scanner to work.

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02

Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

I've made a small adjustment to stop adding a newline ( \n ) if the last line is reached. code while (line != null) { sb.append(line); line = br.readLine(); // Only add new line when curline is NOT the last line.. if(line != null) { sb.append("\n"); } }code –  Ramon Fincken Apr 16 '13 at 11:07

I feel it is better to explicitly give the encoding option and use the FileInputStream rather than directly the FileReader ? See this question too stackoverflow.com/questions/696626/… `reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("<filePath>", "UTF-8"); –  Alex Punnen Jun 4 '13 at 6:43

Similar to Apache Common IO IOUtils#toString() is sun.misc.IOUtils#readFully(), which is included in the Sun/Oracle JREs. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:55

For performance always call sb.append('\n') in preference to sb.append("\n") as a char is appended to the StringBuilder faster than a String –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:58

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;
}

This technique assumes that read() fills the buffer; that the number of chars equals the number of bytes; that the number of bytes fits into memory; and that the number of bytes fits into an integer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:01

The methods within org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils may also be very handy, e.g.:

/**
 * Reads the contents of a file line by line to a List
 * of Strings using the default encoding for the VM.
 */
static List readLines(File file)

Or if you prefer Guava (a more modern, actively maintained library), it has similar utilities in its Files class. Simple examples in this answer. –  Jonik Dec 29 '13 at 13:26

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

I don't see it mentioned yet in the other answers so far. But if "Best" means speed, then the new Java I/O (NIO) might provide the fastest preformance, but not always the easiest to figure out for someone learning.

Probably not as fast as with buffered IO but quite terse:

    String content;
    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(textFile).useDelimiter("\\Z")) {
        content = scanner.next();
    }
The \Z pattern tells the Scanner that the delimiter is EOF

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}
PS : Don't forget to import java.util.*; for Scanner to work.

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

Much faster than what? It most certainly is not faster than appending to a StringBuffer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:02

@gb96 I thought the same about buffer sizes, but the detailed experiment in this question gave surprising results in a similar context: a 16KB buffer was consistently and noticeably faster. –  chiastic-security Sep 12 '14 at 18:14

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;
}

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

I don't see it mentioned yet in the other answers so far. But if "Best" means speed, then the new Java I/O (NIO) might provide the fastest preformance, but not always the easiest to figure out for someone learning.

Probably not as fast as with buffered IO but quite terse:

    String content;
    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(textFile).useDelimiter("\\Z")) {
        content = scanner.next();
    }
The \Z pattern tells the Scanner that the delimiter is EOF

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}
PS : Don't forget to import java.util.*; for Scanner to work.

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

Much faster than what? It most certainly is not faster than appending to a StringBuffer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:02

@gb96 I thought the same about buffer sizes, but the detailed experiment in this question gave surprising results in a similar context: a 16KB buffer was consistently and noticeably faster. –  chiastic-security Sep 12 '14 at 18:14

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

ASCII is a TEXT file so you would use Readers for reading. Java also supports reading from a binary file using InputStreams. If the files being read are huge then you would want to use a BufferedReader on top of a FileReader to improve read performance.

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02
1	 	
Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

I don't see it mentioned yet in the other answers so far. But if "Best" means speed, then the new Java I/O (NIO) might provide the fastest preformance, but not always the easiest to figure out for someone learning.

Probably not as fast as with buffered IO but quite terse:

    String content;
    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(textFile).useDelimiter("\\Z")) {
        content = scanner.next();
    }
The \Z pattern tells the Scanner that the delimiter is EOF

Here is a simple solution:

String content;

content = new String(Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get("sample.txt")));

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}
PS : Don't forget to import java.util.*; for Scanner to work.

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

Much faster than what? It most certainly is not faster than appending to a StringBuffer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:02

@gb96 I thought the same about buffer sizes, but the detailed experiment in this question gave surprising results in a similar context: a 16KB buffer was consistently and noticeably faster. –  chiastic-security Sep 12 '14 at 18:14

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

I also disagree with closing as "not constructive". Fortunately, this could well be closed as duplicate. Good answers e.g. in How to create a String from the contents of a file?, What is simplest way to read a file into String?, What are the simplest classes for reading files? –  Jonik Dec 29 '13 at 13:35
  	 	
Without loops: {{{ Scanner sc = new Scanner(file, "UTF-8"); sc.useDelimiter("$^"); // regex matching nothing String text = sc.next(); sc.close(); }}} –  Aivar Apr 28 '14 at 18:58

ASCII is a TEXT file so you would use Readers for reading. Java also supports reading from a binary file using InputStreams. If the files being read are huge then you would want to use a BufferedReader on top of a FileReader to improve read performance.

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02
1	 	
Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }

The methods within org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils may also be very handy, e.g.:

/**
 * Reads the contents of a file line by line to a List
 * of Strings using the default encoding for the VM.
 */
static List readLines(File file)

Or if you prefer Guava (a more modern, actively maintained library), it has similar utilities in its Files class. Simple examples in this answer. –  Jonik Dec 29 '13 at 13:26 
  	 	
or you simply use the built in method to get all lines: docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:50

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02

Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

I've made a small adjustment to stop adding a newline ( \n ) if the last line is reached. code while (line != null) { sb.append(line); line = br.readLine(); // Only add new line when curline is NOT the last line.. if(line != null) { sb.append("\n"); } }code –  Ramon Fincken Apr 16 '13 at 11:07

I feel it is better to explicitly give the encoding option and use the FileInputStream rather than directly the FileReader ? See this question too stackoverflow.com/questions/696626/… `reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("<filePath>", "UTF-8"); –  Alex Punnen Jun 4 '13 at 6:43

Similar to Apache Common IO IOUtils#toString() is sun.misc.IOUtils#readFully(), which is included in the Sun/Oracle JREs. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:55

For performance always call sb.append('\n') in preference to sb.append("\n") as a char is appended to the StringBuilder faster than a String –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:58

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;
}

This technique assumes that read() fills the buffer; that the number of chars equals the number of bytes; that the number of bytes fits into memory; and that the number of bytes fits into an integer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:01

The methods within org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils may also be very handy, e.g.:

/**
 * Reads the contents of a file line by line to a List
 * of Strings using the default encoding for the VM.
 */
static List readLines(File file)

Or if you prefer Guava (a more modern, actively maintained library), it has similar utilities in its Files class. Simple examples in this answer. –  Jonik Dec 29 '13 at 13:26

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

I don't see it mentioned yet in the other answers so far. But if "Best" means speed, then the new Java I/O (NIO) might provide the fastest preformance, but not always the easiest to figure out for someone learning.

Probably not as fast as with buffered IO but quite terse:

    String content;
    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(textFile).useDelimiter("\\Z")) {
        content = scanner.next();
    }
The \Z pattern tells the Scanner that the delimiter is EOF

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}
PS : Don't forget to import java.util.*; for Scanner to work.

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

@gb96 I thought the same about buffer sizes, but the detailed experiment in this question gave surprising results in a similar context: a 16KB buffer was consistently and noticeably faster. –  chiastic-security Sep 12 '14 at 18:14

        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;
}

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

I don't see it mentioned yet in the other answers so far. But if "Best" means speed, then the new Java I/O (NIO) might provide the fastest preformance, but not always the easiest to figure out for someone learning.

Probably not as fast as with buffered IO but quite terse:

    String content;
    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(textFile).useDelimiter("\\Z")) {
        content = scanner.next();
    }
The \Z pattern tells the Scanner that the delimiter is EOF

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}
PS : Don't forget to import java.util.*; for Scanner to work.

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

Much faster than what? It most certainly is not faster than appending to a StringBuffer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:02

@gb96 I thought the same about buffer sizes, but the detailed experiment in this question gave surprising results in a similar context: a 16KB buffer was consistently and noticeably faster. –  chiastic-security Sep 12 '14 at 18:14

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

ASCII is a TEXT file so you would use Readers for reading. Java also supports reading from a binary file using InputStreams. If the files being read are huge then you would want to use a BufferedReader on top of a FileReader to improve read performance.

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02
1	 	
Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception

        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)

            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

Much faster than what? It most certainly is not faster than appending to a StringBuffer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:02

@gb96 I thought the same about buffer sizes, but the detailed experiment in this question gave surprising results in a similar context: a 16KB buffer was consistently and noticeably faster. –  chiastic-security Sep 12 '14 at 18:14

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

ASCII is a TEXT file so you would use Readers for reading. Java also supports reading from a binary file using InputStreams. If the files being read are huge then you would want to use a BufferedReader on top of a FileReader to improve read performance.

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02
1	 	
Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

I've made a small adjustment to stop adding a newline ( \n ) if the last line is reached. code while (line != null) { sb.append(line); line = br.readLine(); // Only add new line when curline is NOT the last line.. if(line != null) { sb.append("\n"); } }code –  Ramon Fincken Apr 16 '13 at 11:07

I feel it is better to explicitly give the encoding option and use the FileInputStream rather than directly the FileReader ? See this question too stackoverflow.com/questions/696626/… `reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("<filePath>", "UTF-8"); –  Alex Punnen Jun 4 '13 at 6:43

Similar to Apache Common IO IOUtils#toString() is sun.misc.IOUtils#readFully(), which is included in the Sun/Oracle JREs. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:55

For performance always call sb.append('\n') in preference to sb.append("\n") as a char is appended to the StringBuilder faster than a String –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:58

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

I also disagree with closing as "not constructive". Fortunately, this could well be closed as duplicate.

ASCII is a TEXT file so you would use Readers for reading. Java also supports reading from a binary file using InputStreams. If the files being read are huge then you would want to use a BufferedReader on top of a FileReader to improve read performance.

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02
1	 	
Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

I've made a small adjustment to stop adding a newline ( \n ) if the last line is reached. code while (line != null) { sb.append(line); line = br.readLine(); // Only add new line when curline is NOT the last line.. if(line != null) { sb.append("\n"); } }code –  Ramon Fincken Apr 16 '13 at 11:07

I feel it is better to explicitly give the encoding option and use the FileInputStream rather than directly the FileReader ? See this question too stackoverflow.com/questions/696626/… `reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("<filePath>", "UTF-8"); –  Alex Punnen Jun 4 '13 at 6:43

Similar to Apache Common IO IOUtils#toString() is sun.misc.IOUtils#readFully(), which is included in the Sun/Oracle JREs. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:55

For performance always call sb.append('\n') in preference to sb.append("\n") as a char is appended to the StringBuilder faster than a String –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:58

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;
}

This technique assumes that read() fills the buffer; that the number of chars equals the number of bytes; that the number of bytes fits into memory; and that the number of bytes fits into an integer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:01

The methods within org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils may also be very handy, e.g.:

/**
 * Reads the contents of a file line by line to a List
 * of Strings using the default encoding for the VM.

static List readLines(File file)

Or if you prefer Guava (a more modern, actively maintained library), it has similar utilities in its Files class. Simple examples in this answer. –  Jonik Dec 29 '13 at 13:26 
  	 	
or you simply use the built in method to get all lines: docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:50

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

Unfortunately, nowadays there is no readLines(String) and readLines(File) is deprecated in favor of readLines(File, Charset). The encoding can be supplied also as a string. –  Palec Feb 15 at 11:46

I don't see it mentioned yet in the other answers so far. But if "Best" means speed, then the new Java I/O (NIO) might provide the fastest preformance, but not always the easiest to figure out for someone learning.

Probably not as fast as with buffered IO but quite terse:

    String content;
    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(textFile).useDelimiter("\\Z")) {
        content = scanner.next();
    }
The \Z pattern tells the Scanner that the delimiter is EOF

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}
PS : Don't forget to import java.util.*; for Scanner to work.

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02

Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

I've made a small adjustment to stop adding a newline ( \n ) if the last line is reached. code while (line != null) { sb.append(line); line = br.readLine(); // Only add new line when curline is NOT the last line.. if(line != null) { sb.append("\n"); } }code –  Ramon Fincken Apr 16 '13 at 11:07

I feel it is better to explicitly give the encoding option and use the FileInputStream rather than directly the FileReader ? See this question too stackoverflow.com/questions/696626/… `reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("<filePath>", "UTF-8"); –  Alex Punnen Jun 4 '13 at 6:43

Similar to Apache Common IO IOUtils#toString() is sun.misc.IOUtils#readFully(), which is included in the Sun/Oracle JREs. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:55

For performance always call sb.append('\n') in preference to sb.append("\n") as a char is appended to the StringBuilder faster than a String –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:58

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;
}

This technique assumes that read() fills the buffer; that the number of chars equals the number of bytes; that the number of bytes fits into memory; and that the number of bytes fits into an integer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:01

The methods within org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils may also be very handy, e.g.:

/**
 * Reads the contents of a file line by line to a List
 * of Strings using the default encoding for the VM.
 */
static List readLines(File file)

Or if you prefer Guava (a more modern, actively maintained library), it has similar utilities in its Files class. Simple examples in this answer. –  Jonik Dec 29 '13 at 13:26

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

I don't see it mentioned yet in the other answers so far. But if "Best" means speed, then the new Java I/O (NIO) might provide the fastest preformance, but not always the easiest to figure out for someone learning.

Probably not as fast as with buffered IO but quite terse:

    String content;
    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(textFile).useDelimiter("\\Z")) {
        content = scanner.next();
    }
The \Z pattern tells the Scanner that the delimiter is EOF

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}
PS : Don't forget to import java.util.*; for Scanner to work.

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

Much faster than what? It most certainly is not faster than appending to a StringBuffer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:02

@gb96 I thought the same about buffer sizes, but the detailed experiment in this question gave surprising results in a similar context: a 16KB buffer was consistently and noticeably faster. –  chiastic-security Sep 12 '14 at 18:14

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;
}

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

I don't see it mentioned yet in the other answers so far. But if "Best" means speed, then the new Java I/O (NIO) might provide the fastest preformance, but not always the easiest to figure out for someone learning.

Probably not as fast as with buffered IO but quite terse:

    String content;
    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(textFile).useDelimiter("\\Z")) {
        content = scanner.next();
    }
The \Z pattern tells the Scanner that the delimiter is EOF

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}
PS : Don't forget to import java.util.*; for Scanner to work.

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

Much faster than what? It most certainly is not faster than appending to a StringBuffer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:02

@gb96 I thought the same about buffer sizes, but the detailed experiment in this question gave surprising results in a similar context: a 16KB buffer was consistently and noticeably faster. –  chiastic-security Sep 12 '14 at 18:14

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

ASCII is a TEXT file so you would use Readers for reading. Java also supports reading from a binary file using InputStreams. If the files being read are huge then you would want to use a BufferedReader on top of a FileReader to improve read performance.

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02
1	 	
Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception

        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)

            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

Much faster than what? It most certainly is not faster than appending to a StringBuffer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:02

@gb96 I thought the same about buffer sizes, but the detailed experiment in this question gave surprising results in a similar context: a 16KB buffer was consistently and noticeably faster. –  chiastic-security Sep 12 '14 at 18:14

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

ASCII is a TEXT file so you would use Readers for reading. Java also supports reading from a binary file using InputStreams. If the files being read are huge then you would want to use a BufferedReader on top of a FileReader to improve read performance.

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02
1	 	
Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

I've made a small adjustment to stop adding a newline ( \n ) if the last line is reached. code while (line != null) { sb.append(line); line = br.readLine(); // Only add new line when curline is NOT the last line.. if(line != null) { sb.append("\n"); } }code –  Ramon Fincken Apr 16 '13 at 11:07

I feel it is better to explicitly give the encoding option and use the FileInputStream rather than directly the FileReader ? See this question too stackoverflow.com/questions/696626/… `reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("<filePath>", "UTF-8"); –  Alex Punnen Jun 4 '13 at 6:43

Similar to Apache Common IO IOUtils#toString() is sun.misc.IOUtils#readFully(), which is included in the Sun/Oracle JREs. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:55

For performance always call sb.append('\n') in preference to sb.append("\n") as a char is appended to the StringBuilder faster than a String –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:58

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

I also disagree with closing as "not constructive". Fortunately, this could well be closed as duplicate.

ASCII is a TEXT file so you would use Readers for reading. Java also supports reading from a binary file using InputStreams. If the files being read are huge then you would want to use a BufferedReader on top of a FileReader to improve read performance.

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02
1	 	
Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

I've made a small adjustment to stop adding a newline ( \n ) if the last line is reached. code while (line != null) { sb.append(line); line = br.readLine(); // Only add new line when curline is NOT the last line.. if(line != null) { sb.append("\n"); } }code –  Ramon Fincken Apr 16 '13 at 11:07

I feel it is better to explicitly give the encoding option and use the FileInputStream rather than directly the FileReader ? See this question too stackoverflow.com/questions/696626/… `reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("<filePath>", "UTF-8"); –  Alex Punnen Jun 4 '13 at 6:43

Similar to Apache Common IO IOUtils#toString() is sun.misc.IOUtils#readFully(), which is included in the Sun/Oracle JREs. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:55

For performance always call sb.append('\n') in preference to sb.append("\n") as a char is appended to the StringBuilder faster than a String –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:58

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;
}

This technique assumes that read() fills the buffer; that the number of chars equals the number of bytes; that the number of bytes fits into memory; and that the number of bytes fits into an integer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:01

The methods within org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils may also be very handy, e.g.:

/**
 * Reads the contents of a file line by line to a List
 * of Strings using the default encoding for the VM.

static List readLines(File file)

Or if you prefer Guava (a more modern, actively maintained library), it has similar utilities in its Files class. Simple examples in this answer. –  Jonik Dec 29 '13 at 13:26 
  	 	
or you simply use the built in method to get all lines: docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:50

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

Unfortunately, nowadays there is no readLines(String) and readLines(File) is deprecated in favor of readLines(File, Charset). The encoding can be supplied also as a string. –  Palec Feb 15 at 11:46

I don't see it mentioned yet in the other answers so far. But if "Best" means speed, then the new Java I/O (NIO) might provide the fastest preformance, but not always the easiest to figure out for someone learning.

Probably not as fast as with buffered IO but quite terse:

    String content;
    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(textFile).useDelimiter("\\Z")) {
        content = scanner.next();
    }
The \Z pattern tells the Scanner that the delimiter is EOF

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}
PS : Don't forget to import java.util.*; for Scanner to work.

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02

Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

I've made a small adjustment to stop adding a newline ( \n ) if the last line is reached. code while (line != null) { sb.append(line); line = br.readLine(); // Only add new line when curline is NOT the last line.. if(line != null) { sb.append("\n"); } }code –  Ramon Fincken Apr 16 '13 at 11:07

I feel it is better to explicitly give the encoding option and use the FileInputStream rather than directly the FileReader ? See this question too stackoverflow.com/questions/696626/… `reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("<filePath>", "UTF-8"); –  Alex Punnen Jun 4 '13 at 6:43

Similar to Apache Common IO IOUtils#toString() is sun.misc.IOUtils#readFully(), which is included in the Sun/Oracle JREs. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:55

For performance always call sb.append('\n') in preference to sb.append("\n") as a char is appended to the StringBuilder faster than a String –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:58

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;
}

This technique assumes that read() fills the buffer; that the number of chars equals the number of bytes; that the number of bytes fits into memory; and that the number of bytes fits into an integer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:01

The methods within org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils may also be very handy, e.g.:

/**
 * Reads the contents of a file line by line to a List
 * of Strings using the default encoding for the VM.
 */
static List readLines(File file)

Or if you prefer Guava (a more modern, actively maintained library), it has similar utilities in its Files class. Simple examples in this answer. –  Jonik Dec 29 '13 at 13:26

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

I don't see it mentioned yet in the other answers so far. But if "Best" means speed, then the new Java I/O (NIO) might provide the fastest preformance, but not always the easiest to figure out for someone learning.

Probably not as fast as with buffered IO but quite terse:

    String content;
    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(textFile).useDelimiter("\\Z")) {
        content = scanner.next();
    }
The \Z pattern tells the Scanner that the delimiter is EOF

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}
PS : Don't forget to import java.util.*; for Scanner to work.

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

Much faster than what? It most certainly is not faster than appending to a StringBuffer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:02

@gb96 I thought the same about buffer sizes, but the detailed experiment in this question gave surprising results in a similar context: a 16KB buffer was consistently and noticeably faster. –  chiastic-security Sep 12 '14 at 18:14

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;
}

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

I don't see it mentioned yet in the other answers so far. But if "Best" means speed, then the new Java I/O (NIO) might provide the fastest preformance, but not always the easiest to figure out for someone learning.

Probably not as fast as with buffered IO but quite terse:

    String content;
    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(textFile).useDelimiter("\\Z")) {
        content = scanner.next();
    }
The \Z pattern tells the Scanner that the delimiter is EOF

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}
PS : Don't forget to import java.util.*; for Scanner to work.

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

Much faster than what? It most certainly is not faster than appending to a StringBuffer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:02

@gb96 I thought the same about buffer sizes, but the detailed experiment in this question gave surprising results in a similar context: a 16KB buffer was consistently and noticeably faster. –  chiastic-security Sep 12 '14 at 18:14

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

ASCII is a TEXT file so you would use Readers for reading. Java also supports reading from a binary file using InputStreams. If the files being read are huge then you would want to use a BufferedReader on top of a FileReader to improve read performance.

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02
1	 	
Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception

        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)

            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

Much faster than what? It most certainly is not faster than appending to a StringBuffer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:02

@gb96 I thought the same about buffer sizes, but the detailed experiment in this question gave surprising results in a similar context: a 16KB buffer was consistently and noticeably faster. –  chiastic-security Sep 12 '14 at 18:14

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

ASCII is a TEXT file so you would use Readers for reading. Java also supports reading from a binary file using InputStreams. If the files being read are huge then you would want to use a BufferedReader on top of a FileReader to improve read performance.

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02
1	 	
Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

I've made a small adjustment to stop adding a newline ( \n ) if the last line is reached. code while (line != null) { sb.append(line); line = br.readLine(); // Only add new line when curline is NOT the last line.. if(line != null) { sb.append("\n"); } }code –  Ramon Fincken Apr 16 '13 at 11:07

I feel it is better to explicitly give the encoding option and use the FileInputStream rather than directly the FileReader ? See this question too stackoverflow.com/questions/696626/… `reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("<filePath>", "UTF-8"); –  Alex Punnen Jun 4 '13 at 6:43

Similar to Apache Common IO IOUtils#toString() is sun.misc.IOUtils#readFully(), which is included in the Sun/Oracle JREs. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:55

For performance always call sb.append('\n') in preference to sb.append("\n") as a char is appended to the StringBuilder faster than a String –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:58

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

I also disagree with closing as "not constructive". Fortunately, this could well be closed as duplicate.

ASCII is a TEXT file so you would use Readers for reading. Java also supports reading from a binary file using InputStreams. If the files being read are huge then you would want to use a BufferedReader on top of a FileReader to improve read performance.

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02
1	 	
Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

I've made a small adjustment to stop adding a newline ( \n ) if the last line is reached. code while (line != null) { sb.append(line); line = br.readLine(); // Only add new line when curline is NOT the last line.. if(line != null) { sb.append("\n"); } }code –  Ramon Fincken Apr 16 '13 at 11:07

I feel it is better to explicitly give the encoding option and use the FileInputStream rather than directly the FileReader ? See this question too stackoverflow.com/questions/696626/… `reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("<filePath>", "UTF-8"); –  Alex Punnen Jun 4 '13 at 6:43

Similar to Apache Common IO IOUtils#toString() is sun.misc.IOUtils#readFully(), which is included in the Sun/Oracle JREs. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:55

For performance always call sb.append('\n') in preference to sb.append("\n") as a char is appended to the StringBuilder faster than a String –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:58

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;
}

This technique assumes that read() fills the buffer; that the number of chars equals the number of bytes; that the number of bytes fits into memory; and that the number of bytes fits into an integer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:01

The methods within org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils may also be very handy, e.g.:

/**
 * Reads the contents of a file line by line to a List
 * of Strings using the default encoding for the VM.

static List readLines(File file)

Or if you prefer Guava (a more modern, actively maintained library), it has similar utilities in its Files class. Simple examples in this answer. –  Jonik Dec 29 '13 at 13:26 
  	 	
or you simply use the built in method to get all lines: docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:50

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

Unfortunately, nowadays there is no readLines(String) and readLines(File) is deprecated in favor of readLines(File, Charset). The encoding can be supplied also as a string. –  Palec Feb 15 at 11:46

I don't see it mentioned yet in the other answers so far. But if "Best" means speed, then the new Java I/O (NIO) might provide the fastest preformance, but not always the easiest to figure out for someone learning.

Probably not as fast as with buffered IO but quite terse:

    String content;
    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(textFile).useDelimiter("\\Z")) {
        content = scanner.next();
    }
The \Z pattern tells the Scanner that the delimiter is EOF

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}
PS : Don't forget to import java.util.*; for Scanner to work.

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

I also disagree with closing as "not constructive". Fortunately, this could well be closed as duplicate. Good answers e.g. in How to create a String from the contents of a file?, What is simplest way to read a file into String?, What are the simplest classes for reading files? –  Jonik Dec 29 '13 at 13:35
  	 	
Without loops: {{{ Scanner sc = new Scanner(file, "UTF-8"); sc.useDelimiter("$^"); // regex matching nothing String text = sc.next(); sc.close(); }}} –  Aivar Apr 28 '14 at 18:58

ASCII is a TEXT file so you would use Readers for reading. Java also supports reading from a binary file using InputStreams. If the files being read are huge then you would want to use a BufferedReader on top of a FileReader to improve read performance.

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02

Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }

The methods within org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils may also be very handy, e.g.:

/**
 * Reads the contents of a file line by line to a List
 * of Strings using the default encoding for the VM.
 */
static List readLines(File file)

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

I don't see it mentioned yet in the other answers so far. But if "Best" means speed, then the new Java I/O (NIO) might provide the fastest preformance, but not always the easiest to figure out for someone learning.

Probably not as fast as with buffered IO but quite terse:

    String content;
    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(textFile).useDelimiter("\\Z")) {
        content = scanner.next();
    }
The \Z pattern tells the Scanner that the delimiter is EOF

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}
PS : Don't forget to import java.util.*; for Scanner to work.

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

Much faster than what? It most certainly is not faster than appending to a StringBuffer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:02

@gb96 I thought the same about buffer sizes, but the detailed experiment in this question gave surprising results in a similar context: a 16KB buffer was consistently and noticeably faster. –  chiastic-security Sep 12 '14 at 18:14

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

I've made a small adjustment to stop adding a newline ( \n ) if the last line is reached. code while (line != null) { sb.append(line); line = br.readLine(); // Only add new line when curline is NOT the last line.. if(line != null) { sb.append("\n"); } }code –  Ramon Fincken Apr 16 '13 at 11:07

I feel it is better to explicitly give the encoding option and use the FileInputStream rather than directly the FileReader ? See this question too stackoverflow.com/questions/696626/… `reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("<filePath>", "UTF-8"); –  Alex Punnen Jun 4 '13 at 6:43

For performance always call sb.append('\n') in preference to sb.append("\n") as a char is appended to the StringBuilder faster than a String –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:58

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;
}

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

Much faster than what? It most certainly is not faster than appending to a StringBuffer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:02

@gb96 I thought the same about buffer sizes, but the detailed experiment in this question gave surprising results in a similar context: a 16KB buffer was consistently and noticeably faster. –  chiastic-security Sep 12 '14 at 18:14

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

ASCII is a TEXT file so you would use Readers for reading. Java also supports reading from a binary file using InputStreams. If the files being read are huge then you would want to use a BufferedReader on top of a FileReader to improve read performance.

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02
1	 	
Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

I've made a small adjustment to stop adding a newline ( \n ) if the last line is reached. code while (line != null) { sb.append(line); line = br.readLine(); // Only add new line when curline is NOT the last line.. if(line != null) { sb.append("\n"); } }code –  Ramon Fincken Apr 16 '13 at 11:07

I feel it is better to explicitly give the encoding option and use the FileInputStream rather than directly the FileReader ? See this question too stackoverflow.com/questions/696626/… `reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("<filePath>", "UTF-8"); –  Alex Punnen Jun 4 '13 at 6:43

Similar to Apache Common IO IOUtils#toString() is sun.misc.IOUtils#readFully(), which is included in the Sun/Oracle JREs. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:55

For performance always call sb.append('\n') in preference to sb.append("\n") as a char is appended to the StringBuilder faster than a String –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:58

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

    try {

        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

I also disagree with closing as "not constructive". Fortunately, this could well be closed as duplicate.

ASCII is a TEXT file so you would use Readers for reading. Java also supports reading from a binary file using InputStreams. If the files being read are huge then you would want to use a BufferedReader on top of a FileReader to improve read performance.

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02
1	 	
Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

I've made a small adjustment to stop adding a newline ( \n ) if the last line is reached. code while (line != null) { sb.append(line); line = br.readLine(); // Only add new line when curline is NOT the last line.. if(line != null) { sb.append("\n"); } }code –  Ramon Fincken Apr 16 '13 at 11:07

I feel it is better to explicitly give the encoding option and use the FileInputStream rather than directly the FileReader ? See this question too stackoverflow.com/questions/696626/… `reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("<filePath>", "UTF-8"); –  Alex Punnen Jun 4 '13 at 6:43

Similar to Apache Common IO IOUtils#toString() is sun.misc.IOUtils#readFully(), which is included in the Sun/Oracle JREs. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:55

For performance always call sb.append('\n') in preference to sb.append("\n") as a char is appended to the StringBuilder faster than a String –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:58

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;
}

This technique assumes that read() fills the buffer; that the number of chars equals the number of bytes; that the number of bytes fits into memory; and that the number of bytes fits into an integer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:01

The methods within org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils may also be very handy, e.g.:

/**
 * Reads the contents of a file line by line to a List
 * of Strings using the default encoding for the VM.

static List readLines(File file)

Or if you prefer Guava (a more modern, actively maintained library), it has similar utilities in its Files class. Simple examples in this answer. –  Jonik Dec 29 '13 at 13:26 
  	 	
or you simply use the built in method to get all lines: docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:50

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

Unfortunately, nowadays there is no readLines(String) and readLines(File) is deprecated in favor of readLines(File, Charset). The encoding can be supplied also as a string. –  Palec Feb 15 at 11:46

I don't see it mentioned yet in the other answers so far. But if "Best" means speed, then the new Java I/O (NIO) might provide the fastest preformance, but not always the easiest to figure out for someone learning.

Probably not as fast as with buffered IO but quite terse:

    String content;
    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(textFile).useDelimiter("\\Z")) {
        content = scanner.next();
    }
The \Z pattern tells the Scanner that the delimiter is EOF

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}
PS : Don't forget to import java.util.*; for Scanner to work.

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02

Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

I've made a small adjustment to stop adding a newline ( \n ) if the last line is reached. code while (line != null) { sb.append(line); line = br.readLine(); // Only add new line when curline is NOT the last line.. if(line != null) { sb.append("\n"); } }code –  Ramon Fincken Apr 16 '13 at 11:07

I feel it is better to explicitly give the encoding option and use the FileInputStream rather than directly the FileReader ? See this question too stackoverflow.com/questions/696626/… `reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("<filePath>", "UTF-8"); –  Alex Punnen Jun 4 '13 at 6:43

Similar to Apache Common IO IOUtils#toString() is sun.misc.IOUtils#readFully(), which is included in the Sun/Oracle JREs. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:55

For performance always call sb.append('\n') in preference to sb.append("\n") as a char is appended to the StringBuilder faster than a String –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:58

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;
}

This technique assumes that read() fills the buffer; that the number of chars equals the number of bytes; that the number of bytes fits into memory; and that the number of bytes fits into an integer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:01

The methods within org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils may also be very handy, e.g.:

/**
 * Reads the contents of a file line by line to a List
 * of Strings using the default encoding for the VM.
 */
static List readLines(File file)

Or if you prefer Guava (a more modern, actively maintained library), it has similar utilities in its Files class. Simple examples in this answer. –  Jonik Dec 29 '13 at 13:26

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

I don't see it mentioned yet in the other answers so far. But if "Best" means speed, then the new Java I/O (NIO) might provide the fastest preformance, but not always the easiest to figure out for someone learning.

Probably not as fast as with buffered IO but quite terse:

    String content;
    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(textFile).useDelimiter("\\Z")) {
        content = scanner.next();
    }
The \Z pattern tells the Scanner that the delimiter is EOF

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}
PS : Don't forget to import java.util.*; for Scanner to work.

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

Much faster than what? It most certainly is not faster than appending to a StringBuffer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:02

@gb96 I thought the same about buffer sizes, but the detailed experiment in this question gave surprising results in a similar context: a 16KB buffer was consistently and noticeably faster. –  chiastic-security Sep 12 '14 at 18:14

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;
}

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

I don't see it mentioned yet in the other answers so far. But if "Best" means speed, then the new Java I/O (NIO) might provide the fastest preformance, but not always the easiest to figure out for someone learning.

Probably not as fast as with buffered IO but quite terse:

    String content;
    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(textFile).useDelimiter("\\Z")) {
        content = scanner.next();
    }
The \Z pattern tells the Scanner that the delimiter is EOF

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}
PS : Don't forget to import java.util.*; for Scanner to work.

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

Much faster than what? It most certainly is not faster than appending to a StringBuffer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:02

@gb96 I thought the same about buffer sizes, but the detailed experiment in this question gave surprising results in a similar context: a 16KB buffer was consistently and noticeably faster. –  chiastic-security Sep 12 '14 at 18:14

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

ASCII is a TEXT file so you would use Readers for reading. Java also supports reading from a binary file using InputStreams. If the files being read are huge then you would want to use a BufferedReader on top of a FileReader to improve read performance.

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02
1	 	
Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception

        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)

            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

Much faster than what? It most certainly is not faster than appending to a StringBuffer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:02

@gb96 I thought the same about buffer sizes, but the detailed experiment in this question gave surprising results in a similar context: a 16KB buffer was consistently and noticeably faster. –  chiastic-security Sep 12 '14 at 18:14

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

ASCII is a TEXT file so you would use Readers for reading. Java also supports reading from a binary file using InputStreams. If the files being read are huge then you would want to use a BufferedReader on top of a FileReader to improve read performance.

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02
1	 	
Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

I've made a small adjustment to stop adding a newline ( \n ) if the last line is reached. code while (line != null) { sb.append(line); line = br.readLine(); // Only add new line when curline is NOT the last line.. if(line != null) { sb.append("\n"); } }code –  Ramon Fincken Apr 16 '13 at 11:07

I feel it is better to explicitly give the encoding option and use the FileInputStream rather than directly the FileReader ? See this question too stackoverflow.com/questions/696626/… `reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("<filePath>", "UTF-8"); –  Alex Punnen Jun 4 '13 at 6:43

Similar to Apache Common IO IOUtils#toString() is sun.misc.IOUtils#readFully(), which is included in the Sun/Oracle JREs. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:55

For performance always call sb.append('\n') in preference to sb.append("\n") as a char is appended to the StringBuilder faster than a String –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:58

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

I also disagree with closing as "not constructive". Fortunately, this could well be closed as duplicate.

ASCII is a TEXT file so you would use Readers for reading. Java also supports reading from a binary file using InputStreams. If the files being read are huge then you would want to use a BufferedReader on top of a FileReader to improve read performance.

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02
1	 	
Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

I've made a small adjustment to stop adding a newline ( \n ) if the last line is reached. code while (line != null) { sb.append(line); line = br.readLine(); // Only add new line when curline is NOT the last line.. if(line != null) { sb.append("\n"); } }code –  Ramon Fincken Apr 16 '13 at 11:07

I feel it is better to explicitly give the encoding option and use the FileInputStream rather than directly the FileReader ? See this question too stackoverflow.com/questions/696626/… `reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("<filePath>", "UTF-8"); –  Alex Punnen Jun 4 '13 at 6:43

Similar to Apache Common IO IOUtils#toString() is sun.misc.IOUtils#readFully(), which is included in the Sun/Oracle JREs. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:55

For performance always call sb.append('\n') in preference to sb.append("\n") as a char is appended to the StringBuilder faster than a String –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:58

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;
}

This technique assumes that read() fills the buffer; that the number of chars equals the number of bytes; that the number of bytes fits into memory; and that the number of bytes fits into an integer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:01

The methods within org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils may also be very handy, e.g.:

/**
 * Reads the contents of a file line by line to a List
 * of Strings using the default encoding for the VM.

static List readLines(File file)

Or if you prefer Guava (a more modern, actively maintained library), it has similar utilities in its Files class. Simple examples in this answer. –  Jonik Dec 29 '13 at 13:26 
  	 	
or you simply use the built in method to get all lines: docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:50

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

Unfortunately, nowadays there is no readLines(String) and readLines(File) is deprecated in favor of readLines(File, Charset). The encoding can be supplied also as a string. –  Palec Feb 15 at 11:46

I don't see it mentioned yet in the other answers so far. But if "Best" means speed, then the new Java I/O (NIO) might provide the fastest preformance, but not always the easiest to figure out for someone learning.

Probably not as fast as with buffered IO but quite terse:

    String content;
    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(textFile).useDelimiter("\\Z")) {
        content = scanner.next();
    }
The \Z pattern tells the Scanner that the delimiter is EOF

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}
PS : Don't forget to import java.util.*; for Scanner to work.

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02

Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

I've made a small adjustment to stop adding a newline ( \n ) if the last line is reached. code while (line != null) { sb.append(line); line = br.readLine(); // Only add new line when curline is NOT the last line.. if(line != null) { sb.append("\n"); } }code –  Ramon Fincken Apr 16 '13 at 11:07

I feel it is better to explicitly give the encoding option and use the FileInputStream rather than directly the FileReader ? See this question too stackoverflow.com/questions/696626/… `reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("<filePath>", "UTF-8"); –  Alex Punnen Jun 4 '13 at 6:43

Similar to Apache Common IO IOUtils#toString() is sun.misc.IOUtils#readFully(), which is included in the Sun/Oracle JREs. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:55

For performance always call sb.append('\n') in preference to sb.append("\n") as a char is appended to the StringBuilder faster than a String –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:58

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;
}

This technique assumes that read() fills the buffer; that the number of chars equals the number of bytes; that the number of bytes fits into memory; and that the number of bytes fits into an integer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:01

The methods within org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils may also be very handy, e.g.:

/**
 * Reads the contents of a file line by line to a List
 * of Strings using the default encoding for the VM.
 */
static List readLines(File file)

Or if you prefer Guava (a more modern, actively maintained library), it has similar utilities in its Files class. Simple examples in this answer. –  Jonik Dec 29 '13 at 13:26

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

I don't see it mentioned yet in the other answers so far. But if "Best" means speed, then the new Java I/O (NIO) might provide the fastest preformance, but not always the easiest to figure out for someone learning.

Probably not as fast as with buffered IO but quite terse:

    String content;
    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(textFile).useDelimiter("\\Z")) {
        content = scanner.next();
    }
The \Z pattern tells the Scanner that the delimiter is EOF

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}
PS : Don't forget to import java.util.*; for Scanner to work.

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

Much faster than what? It most certainly is not faster than appending to a StringBuffer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:02

@gb96 I thought the same about buffer sizes, but the detailed experiment in this question gave surprising results in a similar context: a 16KB buffer was consistently and noticeably faster. –  chiastic-security Sep 12 '14 at 18:14

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;
}

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

I don't see it mentioned yet in the other answers so far. But if "Best" means speed, then the new Java I/O (NIO) might provide the fastest preformance, but not always the easiest to figure out for someone learning.

Probably not as fast as with buffered IO but quite terse:

    String content;
    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(textFile).useDelimiter("\\Z")) {
        content = scanner.next();
    }
The \Z pattern tells the Scanner that the delimiter is EOF

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}
PS : Don't forget to import java.util.*; for Scanner to work.

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

Much faster than what? It most certainly is not faster than appending to a StringBuffer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:02

@gb96 I thought the same about buffer sizes, but the detailed experiment in this question gave surprising results in a similar context: a 16KB buffer was consistently and noticeably faster. –  chiastic-security Sep 12 '14 at 18:14

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

ASCII is a TEXT file so you would use Readers for reading. Java also supports reading from a binary file using InputStreams. If the files being read are huge then you would want to use a BufferedReader on top of a FileReader to improve read performance.

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02
1	 	
Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception

        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)

            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

Much faster than what? It most certainly is not faster than appending to a StringBuffer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:02

@gb96 I thought the same about buffer sizes, but the detailed experiment in this question gave surprising results in a similar context: a 16KB buffer was consistently and noticeably faster. –  chiastic-security Sep 12 '14 at 18:14

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

ASCII is a TEXT file so you would use Readers for reading. Java also supports reading from a binary file using InputStreams. If the files being read are huge then you would want to use a BufferedReader on top of a FileReader to improve read performance.

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02
1	 	
Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

I've made a small adjustment to stop adding a newline ( \n ) if the last line is reached. code while (line != null) { sb.append(line); line = br.readLine(); // Only add new line when curline is NOT the last line.. if(line != null) { sb.append("\n"); } }code –  Ramon Fincken Apr 16 '13 at 11:07

I feel it is better to explicitly give the encoding option and use the FileInputStream rather than directly the FileReader ? See this question too stackoverflow.com/questions/696626/… `reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("<filePath>", "UTF-8"); –  Alex Punnen Jun 4 '13 at 6:43

Similar to Apache Common IO IOUtils#toString() is sun.misc.IOUtils#readFully(), which is included in the Sun/Oracle JREs. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:55

For performance always call sb.append('\n') in preference to sb.append("\n") as a char is appended to the StringBuilder faster than a String –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:58

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

I also disagree with closing as "not constructive". Fortunately, this could well be closed as duplicate.

ASCII is a TEXT file so you would use Readers for reading. Java also supports reading from a binary file using InputStreams. If the files being read are huge then you would want to use a BufferedReader on top of a FileReader to improve read performance.

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02
1	 	
Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

I've made a small adjustment to stop adding a newline ( \n ) if the last line is reached. code while (line != null) { sb.append(line); line = br.readLine(); // Only add new line when curline is NOT the last line.. if(line != null) { sb.append("\n"); } }code –  Ramon Fincken Apr 16 '13 at 11:07

I feel it is better to explicitly give the encoding option and use the FileInputStream rather than directly the FileReader ? See this question too stackoverflow.com/questions/696626/… `reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("<filePath>", "UTF-8"); –  Alex Punnen Jun 4 '13 at 6:43

Similar to Apache Common IO IOUtils#toString() is sun.misc.IOUtils#readFully(), which is included in the Sun/Oracle JREs. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:55

For performance always call sb.append('\n') in preference to sb.append("\n") as a char is appended to the StringBuilder faster than a String –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:58

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;
}

This technique assumes that read() fills the buffer; that the number of chars equals the number of bytes; that the number of bytes fits into memory; and that the number of bytes fits into an integer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:01

The methods within org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils may also be very handy, e.g.:

/**
 * Reads the contents of a file line by line to a List
 * of Strings using the default encoding for the VM.

static List readLines(File file)

Or if you prefer Guava (a more modern, actively maintained library), it has similar utilities in its Files class. Simple examples in this answer. –  Jonik Dec 29 '13 at 13:26 
  	 	
or you simply use the built in method to get all lines: docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:50

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

Unfortunately, nowadays there is no readLines(String) and readLines(File) is deprecated in favor of readLines(File, Charset). The encoding can be supplied also as a string. –  Palec Feb 15 at 11:46

I don't see it mentioned yet in the other answers so far. But if "Best" means speed, then the new Java I/O (NIO) might provide the fastest preformance, but not always the easiest to figure out for someone learning.

Probably not as fast as with buffered IO but quite terse:

    String content;
    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(textFile).useDelimiter("\\Z")) {
        content = scanner.next();
    }
The \Z pattern tells the Scanner that the delimiter is EOF

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}
PS : Don't forget to import java.util.*; for Scanner to work.

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02

Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

I've made a small adjustment to stop adding a newline ( \n ) if the last line is reached. code while (line != null) { sb.append(line); line = br.readLine(); // Only add new line when curline is NOT the last line.. if(line != null) { sb.append("\n"); } }code –  Ramon Fincken Apr 16 '13 at 11:07

I feel it is better to explicitly give the encoding option and use the FileInputStream rather than directly the FileReader ? See this question too stackoverflow.com/questions/696626/… `reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("<filePath>", "UTF-8"); –  Alex Punnen Jun 4 '13 at 6:43

Similar to Apache Common IO IOUtils#toString() is sun.misc.IOUtils#readFully(), which is included in the Sun/Oracle JREs. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:55

For performance always call sb.append('\n') in preference to sb.append("\n") as a char is appended to the StringBuilder faster than a String –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:58

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;
}

This technique assumes that read() fills the buffer; that the number of chars equals the number of bytes; that the number of bytes fits into memory; and that the number of bytes fits into an integer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:01

The methods within org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils may also be very handy, e.g.:

/**
 * Reads the contents of a file line by line to a List
 * of Strings using the default encoding for the VM.
 */
static List readLines(File file)

Or if you prefer Guava (a more modern, actively maintained library), it has similar utilities in its Files class. Simple examples in this answer. –  Jonik Dec 29 '13 at 13:26

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

I don't see it mentioned yet in the other answers so far. But if "Best" means speed, then the new Java I/O (NIO) might provide the fastest preformance, but not always the easiest to figure out for someone learning.

Probably not as fast as with buffered IO but quite terse:

    String content;
    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(textFile).useDelimiter("\\Z")) {
        content = scanner.next();
    }
The \Z pattern tells the Scanner that the delimiter is EOF

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}
PS : Don't forget to import java.util.*; for Scanner to work.

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

Much faster than what? It most certainly is not faster than appending to a StringBuffer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:02

@gb96 I thought the same about buffer sizes, but the detailed experiment in this question gave surprising results in a similar context: a 16KB buffer was consistently and noticeably faster. –  chiastic-security Sep 12 '14 at 18:14

I've made a small adjustment to stop adding a newline ( \n ) if the last line is reached. code while (line != null) { sb.append(line); line = br.readLine(); // Only add new line when curline is NOT the last line.. if(line != null) { sb.append("\n"); } }code –  Ramon Fincken Apr 16 '13 at 11:07

I feel it is better to explicitly give the encoding option and use the FileInputStream rather than directly the FileReader ? See this question too stackoverflow.com/questions/696626/… `reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("<filePath>", "UTF-8"); –  Alex Punnen Jun 4 '13 at 6:43

Similar to Apache Common IO IOUtils#toString() is sun.misc.IOUtils#readFully(), which is included in the Sun/Oracle JREs. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:55

For performance always call sb.append('\n') in preference to sb.append("\n") as a char is appended to the StringBuilder faster than a String –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:58

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;
}

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

Much faster than what? It most certainly is not faster than appending to a StringBuffer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:02

@gb96 I thought the same about buffer sizes, but the detailed experiment in this question gave surprising results in a similar context: a 16KB buffer was consistently and noticeably faster. –  chiastic-security Sep 12 '14 at 18:14

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

ASCII is a TEXT file so you would use Readers for reading. Java also supports reading from a binary file using InputStreams. If the files being read are huge then you would want to use a BufferedReader on top of a FileReader to improve read performance.

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02
1	 	
Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }

The methods within org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils may also be very handy, e.g.:

/**
 * Reads the contents of a file line by line to a List
 * of Strings using the default encoding for the VM.
 */
static List readLines(File file)

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

I also disagree with closing as "not constructive". Fortunately, this could well be closed as duplicate.

ASCII is a TEXT file so you would use Readers for reading. Java also supports reading from a binary file using InputStreams. If the files being read are huge then you would want to use a BufferedReader on top of a FileReader to improve read performance.

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02
1	 	
Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

I've made a small adjustment to stop adding a newline ( \n ) if the last line is reached. code while (line != null) { sb.append(line); line = br.readLine(); // Only add new line when curline is NOT the last line.. if(line != null) { sb.append("\n"); } }code –  Ramon Fincken Apr 16 '13 at 11:07

I feel it is better to explicitly give the encoding option and use the FileInputStream rather than directly the FileReader ? See this question too stackoverflow.com/questions/696626/… `reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("<filePath>", "UTF-8"); –  Alex Punnen Jun 4 '13 at 6:43

Similar to Apache Common IO IOUtils#toString() is sun.misc.IOUtils#readFully(), which is included in the Sun/Oracle JREs. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:55

For performance always call sb.append('\n') in preference to sb.append("\n") as a char is appended to the StringBuilder faster than a String –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:58

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;
}

This technique assumes that read() fills the buffer; that the number of chars equals the number of bytes; that the number of bytes fits into memory; and that the number of bytes fits into an integer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:01

The methods within org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils may also be very handy, e.g.:

/**
 * Reads the contents of a file line by line to a List
 * of Strings using the default encoding for the VM.

static List readLines(File file)

Or if you prefer Guava (a more modern, actively maintained library), it has similar utilities in its Files class. Simple examples in this answer. –  Jonik Dec 29 '13 at 13:26 
  	 	
or you simply use the built in method to get all lines: docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:50

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

Unfortunately, nowadays there is no readLines(String) and readLines(File) is deprecated in favor of readLines(File, Charset). The encoding can be supplied also as a string. –  Palec Feb 15 at 11:46

I don't see it mentioned yet in the other answers so far. But if "Best" means speed, then the new Java I/O (NIO) might provide the fastest preformance, but not always the easiest to figure out for someone learning.

Probably not as fast as with buffered IO but quite terse:

    String content;
    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(textFile).useDelimiter("\\Z")) {
        content = scanner.next();
    }
The \Z pattern tells the Scanner that the delimiter is EOF

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}
PS : Don't forget to import java.util.*; for Scanner to work.

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02

Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

I've made a small adjustment to stop adding a newline ( \n ) if the last line is reached. code while (line != null) { sb.append(line); line = br.readLine(); // Only add new line when curline is NOT the last line.. if(line != null) { sb.append("\n"); } }code –  Ramon Fincken Apr 16 '13 at 11:07

I feel it is better to explicitly give the encoding option and use the FileInputStream rather than directly the FileReader ? See this question too stackoverflow.com/questions/696626/… `reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("<filePath>", "UTF-8"); –  Alex Punnen Jun 4 '13 at 6:43

Similar to Apache Common IO IOUtils#toString() is sun.misc.IOUtils#readFully(), which is included in the Sun/Oracle JREs. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:55

For performance always call sb.append('\n') in preference to sb.append("\n") as a char is appended to the StringBuilder faster than a String –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:58

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;
}

This technique assumes that read() fills the buffer; that the number of chars equals the number of bytes; that the number of bytes fits into memory; and that the number of bytes fits into an integer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:01

The methods within org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils may also be very handy, e.g.:

/**
 * Reads the contents of a file line by line to a List
 * of Strings using the default encoding for the VM.
 */
static List readLines(File file)

Or if you prefer Guava (a more modern, actively maintained library), it has similar utilities in its Files class. Simple examples in this answer. –  Jonik Dec 29 '13 at 13:26

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

I don't see it mentioned yet in the other answers so far. But if "Best" means speed, then the new Java I/O (NIO) might provide the fastest preformance, but not always the easiest to figure out for someone learning.

Probably not as fast as with buffered IO but quite terse:

    String content;
    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(textFile).useDelimiter("\\Z")) {
        content = scanner.next();
    }
The \Z pattern tells the Scanner that the delimiter is EOF

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}
PS : Don't forget to import java.util.*; for Scanner to work.

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

Much faster than what? It most certainly is not faster than appending to a StringBuffer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:02

@gb96 I thought the same about buffer sizes, but the detailed experiment in this question gave surprising results in a similar context: a 16KB buffer was consistently and noticeably faster. –  chiastic-security Sep 12 '14 at 18:14

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;
}

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

I don't see it mentioned yet in the other answers so far. But if "Best" means speed, then the new Java I/O (NIO) might provide the fastest preformance, but not always the easiest to figure out for someone learning.

Probably not as fast as with buffered IO but quite terse:

    String content;
    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(textFile).useDelimiter("\\Z")) {
        content = scanner.next();
    }
The \Z pattern tells the Scanner that the delimiter is EOF

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}
PS : Don't forget to import java.util.*; for Scanner to work.

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

Much faster than what? It most certainly is not faster than appending to a StringBuffer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:02

@gb96 I thought the same about buffer sizes, but the detailed experiment in this question gave surprising results in a similar context: a 16KB buffer was consistently and noticeably faster. –  chiastic-security Sep 12 '14 at 18:14

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

ASCII is a TEXT file so you would use Readers for reading. Java also supports reading from a binary file using InputStreams. If the files being read are huge then you would want to use a BufferedReader on top of a FileReader to improve read performance.

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02
1	 	
Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception

        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)

            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

Much faster than what? It most certainly is not faster than appending to a StringBuffer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:02

@gb96 I thought the same about buffer sizes, but the detailed experiment in this question gave surprising results in a similar context: a 16KB buffer was consistently and noticeably faster. –  chiastic-security Sep 12 '14 at 18:14

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

ASCII is a TEXT file so you would use Readers for reading. Java also supports reading from a binary file using InputStreams. If the files being read are huge then you would want to use a BufferedReader on top of a FileReader to improve read performance.

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02
1	 	
Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

I've made a small adjustment to stop adding a newline ( \n ) if the last line is reached. code while (line != null) { sb.append(line); line = br.readLine(); // Only add new line when curline is NOT the last line.. if(line != null) { sb.append("\n"); } }code –  Ramon Fincken Apr 16 '13 at 11:07

I feel it is better to explicitly give the encoding option and use the FileInputStream rather than directly the FileReader ? See this question too stackoverflow.com/questions/696626/… `reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("<filePath>", "UTF-8"); –  Alex Punnen Jun 4 '13 at 6:43

Similar to Apache Common IO IOUtils#toString() is sun.misc.IOUtils#readFully(), which is included in the Sun/Oracle JREs. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:55

For performance always call sb.append('\n') in preference to sb.append("\n") as a char is appended to the StringBuilder faster than a String –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:58

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

I also disagree with closing as "not constructive". Fortunately, this could well be closed as duplicate.

ASCII is a TEXT file so you would use Readers for reading. Java also supports reading from a binary file using InputStreams. If the files being read are huge then you would want to use a BufferedReader on top of a FileReader to improve read performance.

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02
1	 	
Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

I've made a small adjustment to stop adding a newline ( \n ) if the last line is reached. code while (line != null) { sb.append(line); line = br.readLine(); // Only add new line when curline is NOT the last line.. if(line != null) { sb.append("\n"); } }code –  Ramon Fincken Apr 16 '13 at 11:07

I feel it is better to explicitly give the encoding option and use the FileInputStream rather than directly the FileReader ? See this question too stackoverflow.com/questions/696626/… `reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("<filePath>", "UTF-8"); –  Alex Punnen Jun 4 '13 at 6:43

Similar to Apache Common IO IOUtils#toString() is sun.misc.IOUtils#readFully(), which is included in the Sun/Oracle JREs. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:55

For performance always call sb.append('\n') in preference to sb.append("\n") as a char is appended to the StringBuilder faster than a String –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:58

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;
}

This technique assumes that read() fills the buffer; that the number of chars equals the number of bytes; that the number of bytes fits into memory; and that the number of bytes fits into an integer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:01

The methods within org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils may also be very handy, e.g.:

/**
 * Reads the contents of a file line by line to a List
 * of Strings using the default encoding for the VM.

static List readLines(File file)

Or if you prefer Guava (a more modern, actively maintained library), it has similar utilities in its Files class. Simple examples in this answer. –  Jonik Dec 29 '13 at 13:26 
  	 	
or you simply use the built in method to get all lines: docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:50

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

Unfortunately, nowadays there is no readLines(String) and readLines(File) is deprecated in favor of readLines(File, Charset). The encoding can be supplied also as a string. –  Palec Feb 15 at 11:46

I don't see it mentioned yet in the other answers so far. But if "Best" means speed, then the new Java I/O (NIO) might provide the fastest preformance, but not always the easiest to figure out for someone learning.

Probably not as fast as with buffered IO but quite terse:

    String content;
    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(textFile).useDelimiter("\\Z")) {
        content = scanner.next();
    }
The \Z pattern tells the Scanner that the delimiter is EOF

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}
PS : Don't forget to import java.util.*; for Scanner to work.

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02

Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

I've made a small adjustment to stop adding a newline ( \n ) if the last line is reached. code while (line != null) { sb.append(line); line = br.readLine(); // Only add new line when curline is NOT the last line.. if(line != null) { sb.append("\n"); } }code –  Ramon Fincken Apr 16 '13 at 11:07

I feel it is better to explicitly give the encoding option and use the FileInputStream rather than directly the FileReader ? See this question too stackoverflow.com/questions/696626/… `reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("<filePath>", "UTF-8"); –  Alex Punnen Jun 4 '13 at 6:43

Similar to Apache Common IO IOUtils#toString() is sun.misc.IOUtils#readFully(), which is included in the Sun/Oracle JREs. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:55

For performance always call sb.append('\n') in preference to sb.append("\n") as a char is appended to the StringBuilder faster than a String –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:58

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;
}

This technique assumes that read() fills the buffer; that the number of chars equals the number of bytes; that the number of bytes fits into memory; and that the number of bytes fits into an integer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:01

The methods within org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils may also be very handy, e.g.:

/**
 * Reads the contents of a file line by line to a List
 * of Strings using the default encoding for the VM.
 */
static List readLines(File file)

Or if you prefer Guava (a more modern, actively maintained library), it has similar utilities in its Files class. Simple examples in this answer. –  Jonik Dec 29 '13 at 13:26

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

I don't see it mentioned yet in the other answers so far. But if "Best" means speed, then the new Java I/O (NIO) might provide the fastest preformance, but not always the easiest to figure out for someone learning.

Probably not as fast as with buffered IO but quite terse:

    String content;
    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(textFile).useDelimiter("\\Z")) {
        content = scanner.next();
    }
The \Z pattern tells the Scanner that the delimiter is EOF

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}
PS : Don't forget to import java.util.*; for Scanner to work.

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

Much faster than what? It most certainly is not faster than appending to a StringBuffer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:02

@gb96 I thought the same about buffer sizes, but the detailed experiment in this question gave surprising results in a similar context: a 16KB buffer was consistently and noticeably faster. –  chiastic-security Sep 12 '14 at 18:14

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;
}

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

I don't see it mentioned yet in the other answers so far. But if "Best" means speed, then the new Java I/O (NIO) might provide the fastest preformance, but not always the easiest to figure out for someone learning.

Probably not as fast as with buffered IO but quite terse:

    String content;
    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(textFile).useDelimiter("\\Z")) {
        content = scanner.next();
    }
The \Z pattern tells the Scanner that the delimiter is EOF

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}
PS : Don't forget to import java.util.*; for Scanner to work.

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

Much faster than what? It most certainly is not faster than appending to a StringBuffer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:02

@gb96 I thought the same about buffer sizes, but the detailed experiment in this question gave surprising results in a similar context: a 16KB buffer was consistently and noticeably faster. –  chiastic-security Sep 12 '14 at 18:14

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

ASCII is a TEXT file so you would use Readers for reading. Java also supports reading from a binary file using InputStreams. If the files being read are huge then you would want to use a BufferedReader on top of a FileReader to improve read performance.

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02
1	 	
Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception

        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)

            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

Much faster than what? It most certainly is not faster than appending to a StringBuffer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:02

@gb96 I thought the same about buffer sizes, but the detailed experiment in this question gave surprising results in a similar context: a 16KB buffer was consistently and noticeably faster. –  chiastic-security Sep 12 '14 at 18:14

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

ASCII is a TEXT file so you would use Readers for reading. Java also supports reading from a binary file using InputStreams. If the files being read are huge then you would want to use a BufferedReader on top of a FileReader to improve read performance.

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02
1	 	
Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

I've made a small adjustment to stop adding a newline ( \n ) if the last line is reached. code while (line != null) { sb.append(line); line = br.readLine(); // Only add new line when curline is NOT the last line.. if(line != null) { sb.append("\n"); } }code –  Ramon Fincken Apr 16 '13 at 11:07

I feel it is better to explicitly give the encoding option and use the FileInputStream rather than directly the FileReader ? See this question too stackoverflow.com/questions/696626/… `reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("<filePath>", "UTF-8"); –  Alex Punnen Jun 4 '13 at 6:43

Similar to Apache Common IO IOUtils#toString() is sun.misc.IOUtils#readFully(), which is included in the Sun/Oracle JREs. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:55

For performance always call sb.append('\n') in preference to sb.append("\n") as a char is appended to the StringBuilder faster than a String –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:58

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

I also disagree with closing as "not constructive". Fortunately, this could well be closed as duplicate.

ASCII is a TEXT file so you would use Readers for reading. Java also supports reading from a binary file using InputStreams. If the files being read are huge then you would want to use a BufferedReader on top of a FileReader to improve read performance.

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02
1	 	
Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

I've made a small adjustment to stop adding a newline ( \n ) if the last line is reached. code while (line != null) { sb.append(line); line = br.readLine(); // Only add new line when curline is NOT the last line.. if(line != null) { sb.append("\n"); } }code –  Ramon Fincken Apr 16 '13 at 11:07

I feel it is better to explicitly give the encoding option and use the FileInputStream rather than directly the FileReader ? See this question too stackoverflow.com/questions/696626/… `reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("<filePath>", "UTF-8"); –  Alex Punnen Jun 4 '13 at 6:43

Similar to Apache Common IO IOUtils#toString() is sun.misc.IOUtils#readFully(), which is included in the Sun/Oracle JREs. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:55

For performance always call sb.append('\n') in preference to sb.append("\n") as a char is appended to the StringBuilder faster than a String –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:58

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;
}

This technique assumes that read() fills the buffer; that the number of chars equals the number of bytes; that the number of bytes fits into memory; and that the number of bytes fits into an integer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:01

The methods within org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils may also be very handy, e.g.:

/**
 * Reads the contents of a file line by line to a List
 * of Strings using the default encoding for the VM.

static List readLines(File file)

Or if you prefer Guava (a more modern, actively maintained library), it has similar utilities in its Files class. Simple examples in this answer. –  Jonik Dec 29 '13 at 13:26 
  	 	
or you simply use the built in method to get all lines: docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:50

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

Unfortunately, nowadays there is no readLines(String) and readLines(File) is deprecated in favor of readLines(File, Charset). The encoding can be supplied also as a string. –  Palec Feb 15 at 11:46

I don't see it mentioned yet in the other answers so far. But if "Best" means speed, then the new Java I/O (NIO) might provide the fastest preformance, but not always the easiest to figure out for someone learning.

Probably not as fast as with buffered IO but quite terse:

    String content;
    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(textFile).useDelimiter("\\Z")) {
        content = scanner.next();
    }
The \Z pattern tells the Scanner that the delimiter is EOF

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}
PS : Don't forget to import java.util.*; for Scanner to work.

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02

Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

I've made a small adjustment to stop adding a newline ( \n ) if the last line is reached. code while (line != null) { sb.append(line); line = br.readLine(); // Only add new line when curline is NOT the last line.. if(line != null) { sb.append("\n"); } }code –  Ramon Fincken Apr 16 '13 at 11:07

I feel it is better to explicitly give the encoding option and use the FileInputStream rather than directly the FileReader ? See this question too stackoverflow.com/questions/696626/… `reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("<filePath>", "UTF-8"); –  Alex Punnen Jun 4 '13 at 6:43

Similar to Apache Common IO IOUtils#toString() is sun.misc.IOUtils#readFully(), which is included in the Sun/Oracle JREs. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:55

For performance always call sb.append('\n') in preference to sb.append("\n") as a char is appended to the StringBuilder faster than a String –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:58

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;
}

This technique assumes that read() fills the buffer; that the number of chars equals the number of bytes; that the number of bytes fits into memory; and that the number of bytes fits into an integer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:01

The methods within org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils may also be very handy, e.g.:

/**
 * Reads the contents of a file line by line to a List
 * of Strings using the default encoding for the VM.
 */
static List readLines(File file)

Or if you prefer Guava (a more modern, actively maintained library), it has similar utilities in its Files class. Simple examples in this answer. –  Jonik Dec 29 '13 at 13:26

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

I don't see it mentioned yet in the other answers so far. But if "Best" means speed, then the new Java I/O (NIO) might provide the fastest preformance, but not always the easiest to figure out for someone learning.

Probably not as fast as with buffered IO but quite terse:

    String content;
    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(textFile).useDelimiter("\\Z")) {
        content = scanner.next();
    }
The \Z pattern tells the Scanner that the delimiter is EOF

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}
PS : Don't forget to import java.util.*; for Scanner to work.

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

Much faster than what? It most certainly is not faster than appending to a StringBuffer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:02

@gb96 I thought the same about buffer sizes, but the detailed experiment in this question gave surprising results in a similar context: a 16KB buffer was consistently and noticeably faster. –  chiastic-security Sep 12 '14 at 18:14

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;
}

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

I don't see it mentioned yet in the other answers so far. But if "Best" means speed, then the new Java I/O (NIO) might provide the fastest preformance, but not always the easiest to figure out for someone learning.

Probably not as fast as with buffered IO but quite terse:

    String content;
    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(textFile).useDelimiter("\\Z")) {
        content = scanner.next();
    }
The \Z pattern tells the Scanner that the delimiter is EOF

The most simple way to read data from a file in java is making use of File class to read the file and Scanner class to read the content of the file.

   public static void main(String args[])throws Exception
    {
       File f = new File("input.txt");
       takeInputIn2DArray(f);
    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception
{
        Scanner s = new Scanner(f);
        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {
                a[i][j]=s.nextInt();
            }
        }
}
PS : Don't forget to import java.util.*; for Scanner to work.

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

Much faster than what? It most certainly is not faster than appending to a StringBuffer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:02

@gb96 I thought the same about buffer sizes, but the detailed experiment in this question gave surprising results in a similar context: a 16KB buffer was consistently and noticeably faster. –  chiastic-security Sep 12 '14 at 18:14

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

ASCII is a TEXT file so you would use Readers for reading. Java also supports reading from a binary file using InputStreams. If the files being read are huge then you would want to use a BufferedReader on top of a FileReader to improve read performance.

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02
1	 	
Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

    }


public static void takeInputIn2DArray(File f) throws Exception

        int a[][] = new int[20][20];
        for(int i=0;i<20;i++)

            for(int j=0;j<20;j++)
            {

For JSF-based Maven web apps, just use ClassLoader and the Resources folder:

Put any file you want to read in the Resources folder.
Use the code below to read it:

String metadata = null; FileInputStream inputStream; try {

ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
inputStream = (FileInputStream) loader.getResourceAsStream("/metadata.json");           
metadata = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
inputStream.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } return metadata;

You can do the same for .properties files, xsd schemas, etc.

This code I programmed is much faster for very large files:

public String readDoc(File f) {
    String text = "";
    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }

    return text;
}

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

Much faster than what? It most certainly is not faster than appending to a StringBuffer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:02

@gb96 I thought the same about buffer sizes, but the detailed experiment in this question gave surprising results in a similar context: a 16KB buffer was consistently and noticeably faster. –  chiastic-security Sep 12 '14 at 18:14

It seems there are a few different ways to read and write data using files.

I am trying to read ASCII data from a file. What are the differences so that I can decide what the best way is?

ASCII is a TEXT file so you would use Readers for reading. Java also supports reading from a binary file using InputStreams. If the files being read are huge then you would want to use a BufferedReader on top of a FileReader to improve read performance.

Go through this article on how to use a Reader

I'd also recommend you download and read this wonderful (yet free) book called Thinking In Java

In Java 7

new String(Files.readAllBytes(...)) or Files.readAllLines(...)

In Java 8

Files.lines(..).forEach(...)

Picking a Reader really depends on what you need the content of the file for. If the file is small(ish) and you need it all, it's faster (benchmarked by us: 1.8-2x) to just use a FileReader and read everything (or at least large enough chunks). If you're processing it line by line then go for the BufferedReader. –  Vlad Aug 27 '13 at 13:45
  	 	
I guess @Vlad is referring to the method of reading entire file into memory explained here java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/… –  Dimitry K Jun 11 '14 at 13:28
  	 	
Will the line order be preserved when using "Files.lines(..).forEach(...)". My understanding is that the order will be arbitrary after this operation. –  DaSh Sep 14 '14 at 18:49
  	 	
@DaSh not sure. Either read the javadoc or try it out. –  Pangea Sep 15 '14 at 12:02
1	 	
Files.lines(…).forEach(…) does not preserve order of lines but is executed in parallel, @Dash. If the order is important, you can use Files.lines(…).forEachOrdered(…), which should preserve the order (did not verify though). –  Palec Feb 15 at 22:45

My favorite way to read a small file is to use a BufferedReader and a StringBuilder. It is very simple and to the point (though not particularly effective, but good enough for most cases):

    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
    try {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    } finally {
        br.close();
    }
Some has pointed out that after Java 7 you should use auto close features:

    try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            sb.append(line);
            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        String everything = sb.toString();
    }
When I read strings like this, I usually want to do some string handling per line anyways, so then I go for this implementation.

Though if I want to actually just read a file into a String, I always use Apache Commons IO with the class IOUtils.toString() method. You can have a look at the source here:

http://www.docjar.com/html/api/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java.html

    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt");
    try {
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    } finally {
        inputStream.close();
    }
And even simpler with Java 7:

    try(FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.txt")) {
        Session IOUtils;
        String everything = IOUtils.toString(inputStream);
    }

I've made a small adjustment to stop adding a newline ( \n ) if the last line is reached. code while (line != null) { sb.append(line); line = br.readLine(); // Only add new line when curline is NOT the last line.. if(line != null) { sb.append("\n"); } }code –  Ramon Fincken Apr 16 '13 at 11:07

I feel it is better to explicitly give the encoding option and use the FileInputStream rather than directly the FileReader ? See this question too stackoverflow.com/questions/696626/… `reader = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("<filePath>", "UTF-8"); –  Alex Punnen Jun 4 '13 at 6:43

Similar to Apache Common IO IOUtils#toString() is sun.misc.IOUtils#readFully(), which is included in the Sun/Oracle JREs. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:55

For performance always call sb.append('\n') in preference to sb.append("\n") as a char is appended to the StringBuilder faster than a String –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:58

there is no need to use readers directly and also no need for ioutils. java7 has built in methods to read an entire file/all lines: See docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… and docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/… –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:48

The easiest way is to use the Scanner class in Java and the FileReader object. Simple example:

Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileReader("filename.txt"));
Scanner has several methods for reading in strings, numbers, etc... You can look for more information on this on the Java documentation page.

Here's another way to do it without using external libraries:

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;


public String readFile(String filename)
{
   String content = null;
   File file = new File(filename); //for ex foo.txt
   try {
       FileReader reader = new FileReader(file);
       char[] chars = new char[(int) file.length()];
       reader.read(chars);
       content = new String(chars);
       reader.close();
   } catch (IOException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return content;

What do you want to do with the text? Is the file small enough to fit into memory? I would try to find the simplest way to handle the file for your needs. The FileUtils library is very handle for this.

for(String line: FileUtils.readLines("my-text-file"))
    System.out.println(line);

    int read, N = 1024 * 1024;
    char[] buffer = new char[N];

    try {
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

        while(true) {
            read = br.read(buffer, 0, N);
            text += new String(buffer, 0, read);

            if(read < N) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch(Exception ex) {

Much faster, I doubt it, if you use simple string concatenation instead of a StringBuilder... –  PhiLho May 28 '13 at 13:41

I think the main speed gain is from reading in 1MB (1024 * 1024) blocks. However you could do the same simply by passing 1024 * 1024 as second arg to BufferedReader constructor. –  gb96 Jul 5 '13 at 0:50
  	 	
i don't believe this is tested at all. using += in this way gives you quadratic (!) complexity for a task that should be linear complexity. this will start to crawl for files over a few mb. to get around this you should either keep the textblocks in a list<string> or use the aforementioned stringbuilder. –  kritzikratzi Mar 23 '14 at 18:55

Much faster than what? It most certainly is not faster than appending to a StringBuffer. -1 –  EJP Aug 28 '14 at 10:02

@gb96 I thought the same about buffer sizes, but the detailed experiment in this question gave surprising results in a similar context: a 16KB buffer was consistently and noticeably faster. –  chiastic-security Sep 12 '14 at 18:14
